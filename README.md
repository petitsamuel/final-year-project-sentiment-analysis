# FYP

Welcome to the repository for my Final Year Project as a CS Major at Trinity College Dublin

## Project Structure

This section includes details on what the different directories of this project contain. More details for each of the projects can be found in their individual README file.

### French News Sentiment Analysis

The dir `./french_news_sentiment_analysis` includes most of the work for this projects. It includes code for fetching data, processing it, loading it into a database as well as all of the data analysis and sentiment analysis system.

### Literature Review

The `./literature_review` directory includes research papers that I've used or may use as part of this project.

### CORD19

the `./cord19` directory includes code to process and load data from the CORD-19 initiative. This leg of the project as this project took a different direction.

### Word Frequency

the `./word_frequency` directory includes code to compute relative word frequencies of french texts using word lemmatisation. The project wasn't pushed much further as another approach was required instead.
