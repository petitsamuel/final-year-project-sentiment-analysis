Chinese government
Among the criticism of the central government are the disapproval of local Hubei and Wuhan government, as well as censorship of information on the early phases of the outbreak.[citation needed]

Censorship and police responses

Document issued by the Wuhan Police ordering Li Wenliang to stop "spreading rumors" about a possible 'SARS virus' dated 3 January.
The early response by the Wuhan authorities was criticised as prioritising a control of information that might be unfavorable for local officials over public safety, and the Chinese government was also criticised for cover-ups and downplaying the initial discovery and severity of the outbreak. By the time China had informed the WHO of the new coronavirus on 31 December, The New York Times reported that the government was still keeping "its own citizens in the dark".[1][2] Observers have also blamed the institutional censorship structure of the country's press that left senior officials with inaccurate information on the outbreak and "contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread".[1][2][3][4] The Human Rights Watch noted that censorship was extended to social media posts from families of infected people seeking help as well as from people living in cordoned cities who were documenting their daily lives amidst the quarantine.[5]

On 1 January 2020, a group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, were taken into custody by Wuhan police and threatened with prosecution for "spreading false information" for characterising the new infection as SARS-like.[6][7][8] Li Wenliang, who informed his former medical school classmates of the coronavirus akin to SARS in a WeChat group after examining a patient's medical report with symptoms of the illness, was warned by the police on 3 January for "making untrue comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order" and made to sign a statement of acknowledgment.[9][10][11] Li later died of the disease on 7 February, which provoked widespread public anger described as "one of the biggest outpourings of online criticism of the government in years,"[12] but some of the trending hashtags on Weibo such as "Wuhan government owes Dr Li Wenliang an apology" and "We want freedom of speech" were blocked.[13][14] Reuters saw a notice sent by the authorities to an online Chinese news outlet asking its editors to not "comment or speculate" on Li's death and to "not hashtag and to let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list and to guard against harmful information".[15] China's anti-corruption body, the National Supervisory Commission, has initiated an investigation into the issues involving Li.[16]

On 14 January, Wuhan Police detained several Hong Kong media correspondents for over an hour when they were conducting interviews at Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital. Reports said the police brought the correspondents to a police station, where the police checked their travel documents and belongings, then asked them to delete video footage taken in the hospital before releasing them.[17][18]

On 20 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping made his first public remark on the outbreak and spoke of "the need for the timely release of information".[19] However, Xi Jinping later also instructed authorities "to strengthen the guidance of public opinions", language which some viewed as a call for censorship.[20] As part of the central government's "bifurcated approach to diffuse discontent", citizens were permitted to criticise local officials so long as they did not "question the basic legitimacy of the party".[21] The Cyberspace Administration (CAC) declared its intent to foster a "good online atmosphere," with CAC notices sent to video platforms encouraging them to "not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official live streaming on the virus."[22] Censorship was briefly relaxed giving a "window of about two weeks in which Chinese journalists were able to publish hard-hitting stories exposing the mishandling of the novel coronavirus by officials", but later news outlets were reportedly required to use "planned and controlled publicity" with the authorities' consent.[13][22]

On 30 January, China's Supreme Court, delivered a rare rebuke against the country's police forces, calling the "unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumors" as undermining public trust, and said that such online posts would allow the public to adopt measures that can help counter the spread of the virus.[23]

Hubei and Wuhan governments

Local officials in Wuhan and the province of Hubei have faced criticism, both domestically and internationally, for mishandling the initial outbreak.[24] Allegations included insufficient medical supplies, hiding evidence of human-to-human transmission in early January, and lack of transparency to the press and censorship of social media during People's Congress meetings for political reasons during the initial weeks of the outbreak.[25][26][27] Criticism was directed at Hubei Governor Wang Xiaodong after he twice claimed at a press conference that 10.8 billion face masks were produced each year in the province, rather than the accurate number of 1.8 million.[28]

Authorities in Wuhan and Hubei provinces have been criticized for downplaying the severity of the outbreak and responding more slowly than they could have. The Beijing-based media journal, Caixin noted that Hubei did not roll out the first level of "public health emergency response mechanism" until 24 January, while several other provinces and cities outside the center of the outbreak had already done so the day before.[29] John Mackenzie, a senior expert at WHO, accused them of keeping "the figures quiet for a while because of some major meeting they had in Wuhan," alleging that there was a "period of very poor reporting, or very poor communication" in early January.[30]

On 19 January, four days before the city quarantine, a wan jia yan (Chinese: ???; literally: 'banquet of myriad families') was held in Wuhan, with over 40,000 families turning out; this attracted retrospective criticism. The domestic The Beijing News argued that the local authorities should not have held such a public assembly while attempting to control the outbreak. The paper also stated that when their journalists visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where the coronavirus likely originated, most residents and merchants there were not wearing face masks.[31] Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, later spoke to China Central Television, explaining that the banquet was held annually, that it is a "sample of the people's self-autonomy," and that the decision was made based on the fact that scientists then wrongly believed that the virus's ability to spread between humans was limited.[32][33] Meanwhile, on 20 January, Wuhan's municipal department for culture and tourism gave out 200,000 tickets valid for visiting all tourist attractions in Wuhan to its citizens for free. The department was later criticized for disregarding the outbreak.[31]

Tang Zhihong, the chief of the health department in Huanggang, was fired hours after she was unable to answer questions on how many people in her city were being treated.[23]

Central government of China
Main article: 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China § Central Government
In contrast to the widespread criticism of the local response, the central government has been praised by international experts and state media for its handling of the crisis.[34][35] This has led to suggestions that it is an attempt by the state media to shift public anger away from the central government and towards local authorities. It has been noted historically that the tendency of provincial governments to minimize reporting local incidents have been because of the central government directing a large proportion of the blame onto them.[36] Critics, such as Wu Qiang, a former professor at Tsinghua University, and Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London, have further argued the same point, with the latter suggesting that it was also exacerbated through local officials being "apprehensive about taking sensible preventive measures without knowing what Xi Jinping and other top leaders wanted as they feared that any missteps would have serious political consequences," a sentiment that Tsang argued was difficult to avoid when "power is concentrated in the hands of one top leader who is punitive to those who make mistakes".[37][38][39] Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang defended himself, referring to those suggestions by publicly blaming regulatory requirements that require local governments to first seek Beijing's approval, which delayed disclosure of the epidemic. He stated in an interview that "as a local government, we may disclose information only after we are given permission to do so. That is something that many people do not understand."[40][41]

In Xi's place, Premier Li Keqiang was dispatched to oversee epidemic control and prevention, with some suspecting that Li was a convenient "political scapegoat".[42] This led to suggestions that the ruling party and state media were attempting to limit the risk of political fallout to Xi during this crisis.[43] The governing party's censorship and propaganda have fueled mistrust of their handling of the outbreak, particularly among young people.[44]

The Chinese government has also been accused of rejecting help from the CDC and the WHO.[45] Insiders at the US CDC complained that China would not agree to on-site visits, while it took two weeks for Chinese authorities to approve an international mission team led by Dr Bruce Aylward but the team composition and scope of work was still yet to be determined.[46]

South Korean government
The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been criticized for unilaterally implementing telephone consultation and prescription without discussing with the Korea Medical Association, and for not restricting traffic from China despite several warnings from the association and a petition proposed by the society.[47][48]

On 22 February, the South Korean government apologized for calling the virus "Daegu Corona 19" in an official report. The term has been widespread on social media and raises concerns about discrimination.[49]

More than 1.5 million South Koreans have signed a petition to impeach President Moon Jae-in over what they claim is the government's mishandling of the outbreak.[50] On 6 March, the South Korean government has only entry restricted to Japanese citizens out of 102 countries that blocked Korea. The action has been widespread on social media and raises concerns about anti-Japanese discrimination.[51][52]

Japanese government

Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, at the first coronavirus expert meeting
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened, as South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts".[53][54] Under the post-war constitution, Japanese people are guaranteed a significant amount of freedoms and individual rights, hence the government does not have powers that can restrict movement in the same manner that Italy and the People's Republic of China can. The government does not have the power to quarantine domestic patients or impose curfews.[55]

Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has been criticized for a perceived delayed response. Critics have observed that while Japan announced the first case of infection on 28 January, it took until 17 February for the Health Ministry to inform the public on how to reach public screening centers and 25 February, for the government to issue a "basic policy" on outbreak response. The overdue response times of the government has led critics to accuse Abe of "callous indifference in the face of an unfolding disaster" and the government as a whole as being "out of touch with the lives of ordinary people that they seem genuinely uninterested in their plight".[56][57]

The strict constraints on testing for the virus by Japanese health authorities have drawn accusations from critics such as Masahiro Kami, a physician and director of the Medical Governance Research Institute, towards Abe of wanting to "downplay the number of infections or patients because of the upcoming Olympics." Reports that only a small select number of public health facilities were authorized to test for the virus, after which the results could only be processed by five government-approved companies, has created a bottleneck where clinics have been forced to turn away even patients who had high fevers. This has led some experts to question Japan's official case numbers, with Tobias Harris, of Teneo Intelligence in Washington, D.C. stating "You wonder, if they were testing nearly as much as South Korea is testing, what would the actual number be? How many cases are lurking and just aren't being caught?"[58][59]

The quarantine measures on the cruise ship Diamond Princess has also been criticised after the ship proved a fertile breeding ground for the virus.[60][61] Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease professor at Kobe University Hospital, said that the condition aboard was "completely chaotic" and "violating all infection control principles".[62] A preliminary report by Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) estimated that most of the transmission on the ship had occurred before the quarantine, based on the first 184 cases.[63] On 22 February, the Health Ministry admitted that 23 passengers were disembarked without being properly tested for the virus.[64] On 23 February, a Japanese woman who tested negative before disembarking from the cruise ship later tested positive after returning to her home in Tochigi Prefecture.[65] She was not among the 23 passengers.[66]

Iranian government

Iranians criticized government authorities for proceeding with elections while the disease was spreading and closing secular spaces while keeping shrines open, especially in the Shia holy city of Qom.[67] Asif Shuja of the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute suggested that "the fact that Iran reported deaths on the same day as its first infections right before its parliamentary elections 'can compel anyone' that there has been a cover-up".[68] Scrutiny has also been targeted at the government's unwillingness to implement area-wide quarantine measures like those implemented by China and Italy, with Iranian officials calling quarantines "old-fashioned."[69] There have been concerns that the Iranian government's official counts were an underestimate.[70] The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that "the WHO has its "own mechanism" for checking facts and has not seen problems with Iran's reported figures".[68]

Italian government
Italy's government has drawn criticism from scientists and WHO, for its decision to suspend direct flights to mainland China that while sounding "tough" on paper, was ineffective as "people can still arrive from risk areas via indirect routes."[71] Walter Ricciardi, professor of Hygiene and Public Health at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome and a member of the European Advisory Committee on Health Research has said "Italy was wrong, closing flights from China is of no use when there are indirect ones."[72]

Criticism followed disclosures by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte that protocols had not been followed at the hospital in Codogno, Lombardy that treated "patient 1" which "certainly contributed to the spread" of the virus in Italy, with Conte responding to inquiries by journalists on what protocol was broken with "This is not the time for controversy."[73] In response to a statement by Conte that the central government may need to "revoke regional health policy powers," President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana called Conte's statement "fascist" and "talking nonsense."[71]

Indonesian government
Many Indonesian criticised the government for slow response and downplaying the pandemic. WHO, Australian government, and United States embassy in Indonesia has expressed their doubt for Indonesian government responses to the pandemic.[74]

West Sumatra provincial government
The governor of West Sumatra province, Irwan Prayitno faced backlash for accepting 174 tourist from China to the province. 174 Chinese tourists from Kunming arrived at Minangkabau International Airport at Padang Pariaman Regency as Citilink adds Padang - Kunming route. Prayitno received further backlash after welcoming the group of tourists by himself at the airport and giving them "grand welcome" with cultural parade. The move has angered the local residents and demand the governor to return the group to China.[75][76]

Failure to detect the virus
Health experts are concerned that the country is failing to identify the transmission of the virus.[77] Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, "analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report ... that Indonesia might have missed cases" of coronavirus disease 2019.[78][79][80] Western diplomats[81][82][83] as well as local[77][84] and international[85][86][87] news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention.[88][89]

Budget for foreign social media influencers
The government faced backlash after instead pledging to set aside IDR 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social media influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia.[90]

Lack of transparency
Indonesian president Joko Widodo is also criticised by Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,[91] human rights groups,[92] and also by political party such as Golkar and Partai Keadilan Sejahtera[93][94] for lack of transparency regarding the information of the COVID-19. Widodo have insisted not to share the travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public.[95]

United Kingdom government
The World Health Organization questioned the UK government's response to COVID-19 with spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris stating in an interview on Today that not enough is known about the science of COVID-19 to justify the UK's approach to developing "herd immunity" against the virus, saying that while "theories" can be talked about, the current situation requires "action".[96] The UK's controversial plan to tackle COVID-19 has been developed by Sir Patrick Vallance and Prof. Chris Whitty.

Government Minister Helen Whately responded by saying that the Government is "following the evidence".

United States government
The U.S. government has received criticism towards the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Centers for Disease Control

CDC Director Robert R. Redfield speaks on the coronavirus outbreak in January 2020
The CDC has been criticized for a number of issues and failures in its approach to the novel coronavirus outbreaks. Among the issues include: a large number of faulty coronavirus test kits sent out to localities throughout the United States, a "woefully" low number of tests being done (3,600 as opposed to over 65,000 in South Korea, a country with a much smaller population), contamination of the lab dealing with the new coronavirus,[97] and removal of the running tally of the number of people tested from its website, which led to allegations of a cover-up.[98]

The CDC was also surrounded in controversy after a suspected patient who was refused a SARS-CoV-2 test by the CDC was later found to be harboring the virus.[99] Timothy Stenzel, the director of the Office of in Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, called what he saw during his tour of CDC facilities "alarming".[97] The HHS has launched an investigation into delays and the relatively slow response of the United States in contrast to countries in Asia.[100] Its handling of the evacuees from Wuhan and the British cruise ship Diamond Princess was also criticized when one of the evacuees, who was released by the CDC and intermingled with the public, later turned out to be positive and infected.[101]

The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the shortcomings of the CDC. It has also ordered that the manufacture of test kits be moved away from the CDC.[102]

Trump administration

Trump, with Azar, signs the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law on 6 March
The Trump administration has come under criticism for its proposed cuts to overall health funding in 2018. Cuts to CDC slashed 80% of its global disease outbreak program,[103][104] forcing the four-year-old program to reduce operations from 49 countries to 10. In its fiscal 2020 budget, the Trump administration proposed eliminating funding for epidemiology and laboratory capacity at state and local levels.[105][106][103] A $30 million Complex Crises Fund had also been cut entirely, which would have allowed the State Department to fund deployment of disease experts in the event of outbreaks.[107] In May 2018, Trump's then-national security advisor John Bolton disbanded a National Security Council global health security team set up to lead the American response to a pandemic.[108]

While the CDC has announced plans to screen people for the coronavirus, only three of the 100 public health labs were reported to be fitted for that role even after delays, which has been attributed to the agency's funding cuts.[109] Trump has been further criticized for proposing further cuts to the CDC and Health Department budgets, of the amounts of 16% and 10%, respectively, in budget requests submitted to Congress on 10 February. The proposed budget also called for a $65 million cut to the US' contribution to funding for the WHO.[110]

Suppression of information
In response to the criticisms of the administration's handling of the crisis, Mick Mulvaney, the White House's acting Chief of Staff in a speech to a conservative audience event accused the US media of being overly-critical and of "stoking virus fears" in hopes that "this is going to bring down the president."[111] On 28 February, Trump asserted Democrats were promoting a "new hoax" to harm him politically and that the press was in "hysteria mode", while attempting to link the outbreak to Democratic immigration policies.[112][113]

When Trump appointed Vice-President Mike Pence to head the country's response to coronavirus, he touted his experience with quelling an epidemic of HIV in Indiana and misrepresented Pence's role in which he deliberately delayed his state government's response to the disease, despite the recommendations of the CDC that needle exchanges were an efficacious approach to reining in the spread of diseases. When he was governor of Indiana, Pence told lawmakers he would veto any bill they might pass that provided for such exchanges.[114]

After the WHO announced the virus had a 3.4% mortality rate out of officially confirmed cases,[115] Trump stated on live national television shared his opinion that this was a "false number", and that based on a hunch he believed the true figure was under 1%.[116] Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that a plausible COVID-19 total fatality rate, out of all COVID-19 infections including ones not formally diagnosed, could be 1%, which is 10 times as lethal as seasonal influenza.[117] Vox pointed out that the case fatality rate of a disease is time and population dependent and that the number could change.[118]

World Bank
The World Bank has been criticized for the slow response of its Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), a fund which was created to provide money to help manage pandemic outbreaks. The terms of the PEF, which is financed by bonds sold to private investors, prevent any money from being released from the fund until 12 weeks after the outbreak was initially detected (23 March). The novel coronavirus outbreak met all other requirements for the funding to be released in January 2020.[119]

Critics have argued that the terms of the PEF are too stringent, and the 12-week delay means that the funding will be much less effective than if it was released to assist governments in initially containing the outbreak. They argue that the fund prioritizes the interests of the private bondholders over public health.[120]

World Health Organization
Main article: World Health Organization § Reactions to WHO response in 2019–20 COVID-19 outbreak
The WHO's handling of the epidemic has come under criticism amidst what has been described as the agency's "diplomatic balancing act" between "China and China's critics."[121] This has included scrutiny of the relationship between the agency and Chinese authorities.[122] Initial concerns included the observation that while WHO relies upon data provided and filtered by member states, China has had a "historical aversion to transparency and sensitivity to international criticism".[123] The WHO and some world leaders have praised the Chinese government's transparency in comparison to the 2003 SARS outbreak,[124] others including John Mackenzie of the WHO's emergency committee and Anne Schuchat of the US CDC have shown skepticism, suggesting that China's official tally of cases and deaths may be underestimates.[125] David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that "China has been very transparent and open in sharing its data … they're sharing it very well and they opened up all of their files" to the WHO delegation that arrived in Wuhan on 22 February.[121][126]

Responding to criticism of his earlier approval of China's efforts, WHO Director-General Tedros stated that China "doesn't need to be asked to be praised. China has done many good things to slow down the virus. The whole world can judge. There is no spinning here,"[46] and further stating that "I know there is a lot of pressure on WHO when we appreciate what China is doing but because of pressure we should not fail to tell the truth, we don't say anything to appease anyone. It's because it's the truth."[127] Tedros also suggested that the WHO would later assess whether China's actions were evidence-based and reasonable, saying "We don't want to rush now to blaming, we can only advise them that whatever actions they take should be proportionate to the problems, and that's what they assured us."[128]

Some observers have framed the WHO as being unable to risk antagonizing the Chinese government, as otherwise the agency would not have been able stay informed on the domestic state of the outbreak and influence response measures there, after which there would have "likely have been a raft of articles criticizing the WHO for needlessly offending China at a time of crisis and hamstringing its own ability to operate."[127] Through this, experts such as Dr David Nabarro have defended this strategy in order "to ensure Beijing's co-operation in mounting an effective global response to the outbreak".[128] Osman Dar, director of the One Health Project at the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security defended the WHO's conduct, stating that the same pressure was one "that UN organisations have always had from the advanced economies."[121]

The WHO's daily situation reports recognize Taiwan as a part of China, with the result of Taiwan receiving the same "very high" risk rating as the mainland by the WHO despite only a having a relatively small number of cases on the ROC-governed island. This has led to Taiwan receiving travel bans from other countries.[129][46] Furthermore, as Taiwan has been excluded from the WHO due to pressure from Beijing after the Tsai's 2016 election, the state may be vulnerable in the case of an outbreak in that territory without proper channels to the WHO. Taiwan president, Tsai Ing-wen, called on the WHO to allow Taiwanese experts to participate in the dialogue and for the WHO to share data on the virus even if it was not possible to admit Taiwan as a member state.[130] In response, the WHO has said that they "have Taiwanese experts involved in all of our consultations ... so they're fully engaged and fully aware of all of the developments in the expert networks."[131] After urging from Japan, the US and the UK, Taiwan was granted participation with Beijing's agreement, who deemed it "necessary under the circumstances to let Taiwan participate in sharing information on the virus." Taiwan has called the move a "meaningful development" in response.[132] Some Taiwanese political observers have viewed such criticism of the WHO as "more politics than real needs," suggesting that "even though we are not in WHO, we can still get this info from many, many other places."[133]

European Union
Although some European politicians have called for Europe's internal borders to be temporarily closed,[134] the European Union decided to turn down the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel area and introducing border controls with Italy.[135][136][137][138][139][140] The deputy leader of the Swiss Ticino League, Lorenzo Quadri, criticized the decision: "It is alarming that the dogma of wide-open borders is considered a priority."[141] United States President Donald Trump said the European Union had "failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots" as the U.S. had implemented.[142]

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš stated that "European countries cannot ban the entry of Italian citizens within the Schengen area. The only possible way is to have the Italian prime minister call on his fellow citizens to refrain from traveling to other countries of the European Union."[143]

After Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Denmark announced complete closure of their national borders, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that "Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization. Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people’s lives and business across the borders."[144]

Politico reported that "EU countries have so far refused Italy's plea for help fighting coronavirus, as national capitals worry that they may need to stockpile face masks and other medical gear to help their own citizens, officials and diplomats said."[145]
