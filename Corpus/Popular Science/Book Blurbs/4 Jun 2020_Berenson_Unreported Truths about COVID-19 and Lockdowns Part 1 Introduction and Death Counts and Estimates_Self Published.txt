Former New York Times reporter and prominent lockdown critic Alex Berenson provides a counterweight to media hysteria about coronavirus in this series of short booklets answering crucial questions about COVID. Drawing on primary sources from all over the world - including state and national-level government data, Centers for Disease Control reports, and papers in prominent scientific journals - Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns offers clear, concise, and measured answers to some of the most important questions around the coronavirus: How are COVID deaths counted? How many Americans are likely to die in a worst-case scenario? What is the evidence that lockdowns do or do not help reduce the spread of the illness? Are masks an effective way to reduce the spread? Why did the forecasts for coronavirus hospitalizations prove so wrong? Are children at serious risk from coronavirus? What has the mental health impact of lockdowns been? Whether you have been skeptical of the media's panicked reporting all along or are just starting to wonder why the predictions of doom from March and April have not come to pass, this guide will provide you with the factual, accurate, and impeccably sourced information you need. Please note: Unreported Truths will be published in multiple sections. Part 1 includes an introduction, an examination of the way COVID deaths are counted, and a forecast for a potential worst-case scenario of coronavirus deaths in the United States.
