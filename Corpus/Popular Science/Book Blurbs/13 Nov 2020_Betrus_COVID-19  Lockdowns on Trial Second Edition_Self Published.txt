In COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial , author and researcher Michael Betrus provides you with a fast-paced journey through the pandemic and the collateral impact of the lockdowns. COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial walks you through the analysis of the earliest data from the cruise ships and the models that triggered the lockdowns, and how the actual data never added up to the life-altering decisions made by governments around the world, and especially in America. To justify lockdowns as an effective mitigation tactic, those states and countries locking down must well outperform those that did not. See how that did not happen anywhere.
You will learn about:

* Impact of the lockdowns that prompted hundreds of thousands of lockdown-deaths, tens of millions of American kids out of class for a year, huge rises in deaths of despair over the lockdowns
* The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and state data with insight from medical sources, like The Lancet and medRxiv
* Analysis of actual COVID-19 deaths and how they were counted
* The most important data point to determine COVID-19’s death impact, and that it’s never talked about
* How the lockdowns triggered record unemployment and economic ruin, and future deaths and despair in likely excess of the COVID-19 deaths
* A breakdown of how the media covered the pandemic, driving panic in the American public and keeping politicians from re-opening after the lockdowns, along with hilarious apocalyptic predictions that never came true
* Social consequences of the lockdowns: increasing domestic violence, distance learning challenges, suicides
* Detailed analysis on school closings and the impact on kids losing the 2020-2021 academic year, as well as outrageous restrictions placed on college students
* The anti-lockdown protests and the struggle to reopen states
* More than 100 charts, graphs, and tables included illustrating the data
* And more

Author Michael Betrus has written over a dozen business books prior to writing the first two editions of COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial, and has conducted hundreds of television, radio and podcast interviews on the pandemic and the lockdowns.

“Michael Betrus has been on the forefront of beating back the media-driven, political and scientific falsehoods that have come to mark so much of this coronavirus chaos in America — and he’s done it the old-fashioned way: with determined research and a dogged pursuit of fact-based statistics. As Betrus makes clear, the coronavirus is real. But the response has been highly suspect. Any scared American needs to read this book to understand how to protect without going overboard. As a matter of fact, “COVID-19: Lockdowns On Trial” ought to be on the nightstand of any scientist, health bureaucrat, member of the media or public servant involved in coronavirus mitigation, as a tool to fight the hype and stay a steady, calmer, even constitutional course.” – Cheryl Chumley, The Washington Times and best-selling author.
