Varadkar says plan is for Leaving and Junior Cert exams to go ahead
The number of people who have now died from coronavirus in Ireland has almost reached the 100 mark.
At a briefing the National Public Health Emergency Team on Thursday evening said 13 new fatalities now bring the total to 98.
A further 402 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland as of lunchtime on Thursday bring the total figure to 3,849.
Of the most recent deaths, nine were located in the east of the country, one in the south and three in the west. There were nine men and four women with a median age of 82 – 10 had underlying conditions.
Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said we are not yet on course to avoid a potential situation in which the number of people requiring intensive care outstrips available beds.
“If we keep growing at the rate we are growing we won’t avoid that scenario so we need to keep improving,” he said.
The latest figures for the Republic came as more than a million cases of coronavirus were registered globally, according to research by Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed deaths worldwide passed 51,000 on Thursday night, with Europe accounting for over half of cases and more than 70 per cent of deaths linked to the virus.
