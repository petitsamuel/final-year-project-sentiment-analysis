WUHAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province tested 9,899,828 people between May 14 and June 1 in a citywide drive to screen novel coronavirus infections, according to a press conference on Tuesday.
No confirmed COVID-19 cases were found in the process, said Lu Zuxun, professor with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology.
Meanwhile, 300 asymptomatic cases were found and quarantined, as well as 1,174 people in close contact. All in the latter group have tested negative for infection, according to Lu.
The city on May 14 launched a campaign to offer nucleic acid tests to those not tested before. Officials said the move was aimed at reassuring the society as the city reopens its factories, businesses and schools.
The city's health commission said the tests are voluntary and free, with all costs borne by city and district governments.
