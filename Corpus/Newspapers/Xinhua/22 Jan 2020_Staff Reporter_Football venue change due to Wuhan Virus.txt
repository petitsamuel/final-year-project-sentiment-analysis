BEIJING, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) confirmed on Wednesday that next month's Olympic women's football qualifying matches would be moved from Wuhan to Nanjing, amid concerns over the spread of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
With the 2019-nCoV virus having spread across several Chinese provinces and 440 cases confirmed, Chinese authorities have urged people not to travel to or from Wuhan, where the virus was first reported in late December.
The central Chinese city was scheduled to host all matches in Group B of the 2020 Olympic women's qualifiers, with China, Australia, Chinese Taipei and Thailand included in the group.
"At the request of the Chinese Football Association, the AFC is now moving the 2020 Olympic Asian women's football Group B qualifying matches from Wuhan to Jiangning Sports Training Center in Nanjing, in China's Jiangsu Province," Asian football's governing body confirmed on social media.
The AFC women's football qualifiers for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo consist of two groups, with South Korea hosting Vietnam and Myanmar in Group A.
The top two teams from each qualifying group will advance to a play-off round to determine which two Asian teams will join hosts Japan at the Games.
