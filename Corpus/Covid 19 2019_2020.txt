The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[6] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.[7] As of 20 March, more than 241,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 170 countries and territories, resulting in more than 9,900 deaths and 87,000 recoveries.[8] On 13 March, the WHO announced that Europe had become the new epicentre of the pandemic.[9]

The virus primarily spreads between people in a manner similar to influenza, via respiratory droplets that people exhale, for example when coughing and sneezing.[10][11][12] It is considered most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear.[13] The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[12][14] Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.[12][14] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment; efforts consist of symptom alleviation and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen days for people who suspect they are infected.[11][12][15]

Efforts to prevent spreading includes travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include a quarantine of Hubei, the nationwide quarantines of Italy, Spain, France, the Czech Republic, and Germany,[16][17] curfew measures in China and South Korea,[18][19][20] various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions,[21][22] screening methods at airports and train stations,[23] and travel advisories regarding regions with community transmission.[24][25][26][27] Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in at least 115 countries, affecting more than 950 million pupils and students.[28]

The pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruption,[29] the postponement or cancellation of sporting and cultural events,[30] as well as widespread fears of supply shortages across various sectors including pharmaceuticals, electronics and food.[31][32] Criticism includes online misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus,[33][34] xenophobia and racism, and panic buying of various products such as food items with a long shelf life, toilet paper and water.[35] Some commentators have called the pandemic the biggest global event since World War II.[36][37]

A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported by health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China on 31 December 2019[166] and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.[167] These cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals; consequently, the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[168] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[169] pangolin coronaviruses[170] and SARS-CoV.[171] It is believed that the virus possibly originated in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus).[172]

The earliest person with symptoms was traced back to 1 December 2019, someone who did not have connections with the later cluster linked to the wet market.[173][174] Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[1][175][176] On 14 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post said that a 55-year-old from Hubei province could have been the first person who contracted the disease on 17 November.[177][178]

On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly dropped in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.[179]

There may be substantial under-reporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.[180][181] Reported numbers may also reflect local decisions on whom and when to test. As an example, on 13 March 2020, the UK reported 798 confirmed cases, but health officials estimated the actual number of people infected was probably between 5,000 and 10,000.[182]

As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among youth, with those 19 and under made up 2.4 percent of cases worldwide.[14][183]

On 19 March 2019 a study based on data (until 29 February) from the Wuhan Outbreak was published in Nature. In addition to data on the official reported cases, the study made estimates on affected individuals unknown to public knowledge. It distinguishes 3 groups: Infected, infected with symptoms and those who went to the hospital. A reference group is the data collected from individuals who left Wuhan from 29. January until 4 February via airports. A vague estimate on the total amount of infected people leads to a basic reproduction number of 1.94. Furthermore it took 7 days from the onset of the disease in one individual, that led to the onset of the disease in another individual in a infector-infectee relationship. The study goes on that with a basic reproductive number of 2, the majority of the population will be infected, except public health interventions are set in force among other measures.[184]

Deaths
Among those who died from the disease, the time from development of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a median of 14 days.[14] As of 19 March 2020, more than 9,100 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.[185] According to China's NHC, most of those who died were elderly – about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[186]

The first confirmed death was on 9 January 2020 in Wuhan.[187] The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[188][189] and the first death outside Asia was in France.[190] By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of Iran, South Korea and Italy.[191][192][193] By 13 March, over 40 countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.[194]

Symptoms of COVID-19 are non-specific and those infected may either be asymptomatic or develop flu like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, or muscle pain. The typical signs and symptoms and their prevalence, are shown in the corresponding table.[197]

Further development can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death. Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, returning test results that confirm infection but show no clinical symptoms, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.[1][198][199][200]

The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to fourteen days; it is most commonly five days.[201][202] In one case, it may have had an incubation period of 27 days.[203]

Transmission

A video discussing the basic reproduction number and case fatality rate in the context of the pandemic.
The primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets that people exhale, for example when coughing or sneezing.[10][204][205] Droplets stay suspended in the air for only a short time but may stay viable and contagious on a metal, cardboard, glass or plastic surface.[206][207][208] The stability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the air and on various surfaces is believed to be comparable to that of other coronaviruses, some of which can survive for up to nine days at room temperature.[209] Its similarity to SARS-CoV-1 in particular was confirmed in laboratory tests that found both viruses could survive up to or beyond 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel.[208] A survey of research on the inactivation of other coronaviruses using various biocidal agents suggests that disinfecting surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 may also be achieved using similar solutions (within one minute of exposure on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine; benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective.[209]

The WHO has stated that the risk of spread from someone without symptoms is "very low". However, if someone has beginning symptoms and a mild cough, there is a risk of transmission.[210] An analysis of infections in Singapore and Tianjin in China revealed that coronavirus infections may be spread by people who have recently caught the virus and have not yet begun to show symptoms.[211]

There have been estimates for the basic reproduction number (the average number of people an infected person is likely to infect), ranging from 2.13[212] to 4.82.[213][214] This is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[215]

Likelihood of multiple waves
As of March 18, Wuhan, along with the rest of China has not had any new cases, raising questions of the potential consequences when social distancing requirements start to be lifted. Estimates are that less than 1% in China have had the disease, leaving more than 99% vulnerable to future waves of infection. With SARS in 2003, there was no transmission to others during incubation and the early symptoms. With COVID-19, there is evidence of early transmission. Ben Cowling, professor of epidemiology at Hong Kong university, said, “This coronavirus is more comparable to influenza.” It is not known how and if Covid-19 may resurface, though some fear it could follow a similar path to the 1918-1919 flu pandemic in which the second and third waves were more deadly than the first.[216]

Virology
Main article: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[171] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[217]

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[218] It is thought to have a zoonotic origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[197][219] In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain genome sequences between the viruses found in pangolins and those from humans, however, whole genome comparison to date found at most 92% of genetic material shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.[220]

Diagnosis
Main article: COVID-19 testing
Infection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions (71% sensitivity) and CT imaging (98% sensitivity).[221]

Viral testing
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first issued on 17 January.[222][223][224][225] Testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[226] The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.[227] Results are generally available within a few hours to days.[228][229]

A person is considered at risk if they have travelled to an area with ongoing community transmission within the previous 14 days, or have had close contact with an infected person. Common key indicators include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. Other possible indicators include fatigue, myalgia, anorexia, sputum production and sore throat.[230]

Imaging
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography have been described in a limited case series.[231] The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[232] However, due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR is of limited use in identifying COVID-19.[231]

Prevention

Infographic by the United States CDC, describing how to stop the spread of germs.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing/sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a dustbin. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.[233][234][235] Social distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[236][237]

Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.[238] However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world. This means that the virus is spreading within communities whose members have not travelled to areas with widespread transmission.[citation needed]

Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions with eye protection.[239]

Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.[240] Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection, for example: rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.[241]

As of 13 March 2020, there is no COVID-19 vaccine though a number of organizations are working to develop one.[242] China has banned the trading and consumption of wild animals.[243]

Hand washing
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. It further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[233] The WHO also advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[234][244]

Respiratory hygiene
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing (the tissue should then be disposed of immediately).[234][245] The use of surgical masks by those who may be infected has been recommended,[246][247][248] as they can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing and coughing.[249] The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.[250]

Masks have also been recommended for use by those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[248] WHO has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although masks may help people avoid touching their faces.[248]

Surgical masks are the lowest grade of protection, and are designed mainly to protect others from the wearer. Masks designed to protect the wearer are technically "respirators", though calling them "masks" is common. Only China has specifically recommended the use of masks by healthy members of the public.[195][249][251] Nevertheless, face masks have been widely used by healthy people in Hong Kong,[252] Japan,[253] Malaysia,[254] and Singapore.[255][256]

Social distancing
Main article: Social distancing
Social distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may also apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, not shaking hands, and physically distancing themselves from others.[257][258][259] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[260][261][262]

The high-risk group includes older adults (60 years of age and older[263]), those with a weak immune system (i.e. due to cancer treatment, treatment for autoimmune diseases, HIV, organ transplant or bone-marrow transplant), smokers[264][265] and those with serious underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, lung disease. They face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised to avoid crowds and stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[266]

Self-isolation
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.[267][268] Additionally, individuals who have recently travelled to a country with widespread transmission or who have been in direct contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 have also been asked by some government health agencies to self-quarantine or practise social distancing for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[11][12][269]

The National Health Service in the UK has recommended that those with symptoms of COVID-19 should stay at home for 14 days, taking precautions to avoid infecting others within the household. As long as symptoms don't significantly worsen health services should not be contacted.[268]

Management

Outbreak

The goal of community mitigation, (1) delay outbreak peak (2) decompress peak burden on healthcare, known as flattening the curve (3) diminish overall cases and health impact.[270][271]
There are two basic strategies in the control of an outbreak: containment (or suppression) and mitigation. Containment is done in the early stages of the outbreak, and aims to trace and isolate those infected to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage, when measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[272]

Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[270] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[270] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at social distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[273]

More drastic actions were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities affecting 60 million individuals in Hubei, and strict travel bans.[274] Other countries adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. For example, South Korea introduced mass screening, localized quarantines, and issuing alerts on the movements of affected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantine themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face-mask production, and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.[275] Some countries require people to report flu-like symptoms to their doctor, especially if they have visited mainland China.[276]

Simulations for Great Britain and the US shows that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) as well as suppression (reversing epidemic growth) has major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, still resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed. Suppression can be preferred but need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (at least 18 months later) as transmission quickly rebounds when relaxed, while long-term intervention causes social and economic costs.[277]

Illness
There are no specific antiviral medications approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medications. Attempts to relieve the symptoms may include taking regular (over-the-counter) cold medications,[278] drinking fluids, and resting.[233] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required.[279] The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.[280] Several compounds, which were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases, are being investigated.[281]

History
Main article: Timeline of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic

Cases in different countries plotted on a logarithmic scale
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.[173] A later unconfirmed claim, citing Chinese government documents, suggests that the first victim was a 55-year-old man who fell ill on 17 November 2019.[282][under discussion] Within the next month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased to a couple of hundred, before rapidly increasing in January 2020. On 31 December 2019, the virus had caused enough cases of unknown pneumonia to be reported to health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China,[166] and an investigation into the illness began early in the following month.[167] These were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, consequently the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.[168]

During the early stages, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[283] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration, with Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange in China; infected people quickly spread throughout the country.[197] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[284] Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020.[285]

On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[286] On 24 February, its director, Tedros Adhanom, warned that the virus could become a global pandemic due to increasing numbers of cases outside China.[287]

On 11 March, the WHO officially declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic, following a period of sustained community-level transmission in multiple different regions of the world.[7] On 13 March, the WHO declared Europe to be the new centre of the pandemic, after the rate of new cases in Europe surpassed those recorded in other regions of the world apart from China.[288] By 16 March 2020, the total number of cases reported around the world outside China had exceeded that of Mainland China.[289] As of 19 March 2020, over 222,000 cases have been reported worldwide; more than 8,600 people have died; and over 84,000 have recovered.[290][185] There is thought to be a substantial under-reporting of cases, particularly of cases with milder symptoms or no symptoms.[291][292]

The first person known to have fallen ill due to the new virus was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan.[173] Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of unknown pneumonia on 26 December, and her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[294] A public notice on the outbreak was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.[295] WHO was informed of the outbreak on the same day.[166] On 1 January 2020, Wuhan police announced eight people, who later found to be all doctors, were summoned and warned for "spreading rumours" likening the disease to SARS.[296][297] Doctor Li Wenliang was also "admonished" by police on 3 Jan.[298] In the early stages of the outbreak, Chinese National Health Commission said that they had no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmissions.[299]

The Chinese Communist Party launched a radical campaign described by the Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.[300] In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history",[301] a quarantine was announced on 23 January stopping travel in and out of Wuhan,[302] which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei.[303] Private vehicle use was banned in the city.[304] Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were cancelled in many places.[305] The authority also announced the construction a temporary hospital Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days, and 14 temporary hospitals were constructed in China in total.[306]

On 26 January, the Communist Party and the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including health declarations for travellers and changes to national holidays.[307] The leading group decided to extend the Spring Festival holiday to contain the outbreak.[308] Universities and schools around the country were also closed.[309][310][311] The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities.[312] Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.[313] Various travel restrictions were enacted.[313][314] Other provinces and cities outside Hubei imposed travel restrictions. Public transport was modified,[315][313] and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.[316][317] Control of movement of people was applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that over half of China's population, around 760 million people, faced some forms of restriction going out of their homes.[318]

After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, many Chinese students studying in Europe and the United States have returned home as the domestic daily new cases in China declined. Chinese authorities has taken strict measures to prevent the virus from "importing" from other countries. For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.[319]

The early response by the Wuhan authorities was criticized as prioritizing a control of information that might be unfavourable for local officials over public safety, and the Chinese government was also criticized for cover-ups and downplaying the initial discovery and severity of the outbreak.[320] Whistleblowing from various Chinese doctors, including Li Wenliang on 30 December revealed that Wuhan hospital authorities were already aware that the virus was a SARS-like coronavirus and patients were already placed under quarantine.[321] However, news of the outbreak was dismissed as "rumour mongering" by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau.[322][323] By the time China had informed the WHO of the new coronavirus on 31 December, The New York Times reported that the government was still keeping "its own citizens in the dark".[324][325] Observers have also blamed the institutional censorship structure of the country's press that left senior officials with inaccurate information on the outbreak and "contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread".[324][325] Some experts doubted the accuracy of the number of cases reported by the Chinese government, which repeatedly changed how it counted coronavirus cases.[326][327][328] The Chinese government has also been accused of rejecting help from the CDC and the WHO.[329]

Although criticisms have been levelled at the aggressive response of China to control the outbreak,[330] China's actions have also been praised by some foreign leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump, and Russian president Vladimir Putin.[331][332] The director of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus congratulated Chinese government "for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak",[333] and a later WHO report described China's response as "perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history".[334] According to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very hard-hit in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to curtail virus spread, and retail sales plunged 20.5%[335]

Italy

The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.[336] In response, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency.[337] On 31 January, the Italian Council of Ministers appointed Angelo Borrelli, head of the Civil Protection, as Special Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency.[338][339] An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later further detected starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.[340]

On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.[341] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."[342][343]

On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths. All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, will be held behind closed doors until April.[344] On 9 March, all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.[345] On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.[346][347]

On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols that might be employed.[348][349][350] As of 19 March 2020, there were 41,035 confirmed cases, 3,405 deaths and 4,440 recoveries in Italy.[351] On 16 March it was reported that in the previous 24 hours 368 people had died of the virus.[352] On 18 March, 4,207 new cases and 475 new deaths were reported by the Civil Protection.[353] After China, it is the worst affected country by COVID-19.[354]

Coronavirus infection prevention tips banner in Seoul
Covid 19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. There was a large increase in cases on 20 February,[355] potentially attributable to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.[355][356][357]

42 Chinese Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan China were suspected by some as propagating the outbreak.[358][359] As of 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 reported symptoms.[360] A petition was circulated requesting the church's disbandment.[361] On 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported,[362] rising to 3,150 on 29 February.[363]

All South Korean military bases were on quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers were indeed positive for the virus.[358] Airline schedules were also affected and therefore they were changed.[364][365]

An analysis of air travel patterns was used to map out and predict patterns of spread and was published in the The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020. Based on information from the International Air Transport Association (2018), Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest volume of travellers from Wuhan. Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people travelling from Wuhan. Bali was reported as least able in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered most able.[444][445]

Countries that have implemented a global travel ban in response to the COVID-19 pandemic
As a result of the outbreak, many countries and regions including most of the Schengen area,[451] Armenia,[452] Australia,[453] India,[454] Iraq,[455][456] Indonesia,[457] Kazakhstan,[458] Kuwait,[459] Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan,[460] Vietnam,[461] and the United States[462] have imposed temporary entry bans on Chinese citizens or recent visitors to China, or have ceased issuing visas and reimposed visa requirements on Chinese citizens.[463] Samoa even started refusing entry to its own citizens who had previously been to China, attracting widespread condemnation over the legality of the decision.[464][465]

The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy,[466][467][468] which has been criticized by some European politicians.[469][470] After some EU member states announced complete closure of their national borders to foreign nationals,[471] the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that "Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization."[472]

Saudi Arabia has temporarily banned foreigners from entering Mecca and Medina, two of Islam's holiest pilgrimage sites, to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the Kingdom.[473] The United States suspended travel from the Schengen Area and the UK.[474] Many countries then started closing their borders to virtually all non-citizens or non-residents in rapid succession, including India,[475] Slovakia,[476] Denmark,[477] Poland,[478] and Lithuania.[479]

Ukraine evacuates Ukrainian and foreign citizens from Wuhan
Owing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation that have been provided clearance by Chinese authorities. Canada, the United States, Japan, India, France, Australia, Sri Lanka, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.[480] Pakistan has said that it will not be evacuating any citizens from China.[481] On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or family members in addition to four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen. The citizens of Poland, China and India got off the plane in Poland, where the Brazilian plane made a stopover before following its route to Brazil. Brazilian citizens who went to Wuhan were quarantined at a military base near Brasilia.[482][483][484] On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 from the first plane, and 39 from a second plane chartered by the US government) were evacuated from Wuhan, China, to CFB Trenton to be quarantined for two weeks. On 11 February, another plane of Canadians (185) from Wuhan landed at CFB Trenton. Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens on 3 and 4 February to the Christmas Island Detention Centre which had been "repurposed" as a quarantine facility, where they remained for 14 days.[485][486][487] A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived at Auckland on 5 February; the passengers (including some from Australia and the Pacific) were quarantined in a naval base at Whangaparoa north of Auckland.[488] The United States announced that it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.[489] On 21 February, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.[490] The Indian government has scheduled its air force to evacuate its citizens from Iran.[491]

International aid

On 5 February, the Chinese foreign ministry stated that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.[492]

The US city of Pittsburgh announced plans to send medical aid to Wuhan, which is its sister city.[493] The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) also announced plans to provide help.[494] Some Chinese students at other American universities have also joined together to help send aid to virus-stricken parts of China, with a joint group in the Greater Chicago Area reportedly managing to send 50,000 N95 masks and 1,500 protection suits to hospitals in the Hubei province on 30 January.[495]

The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in co-ordination with FedEx transportation and logistics support, sent 200,000 face masks along with other personal protective equipment, including gloves and gowns, by emergency airlift to arrive in Wuhan Union Hospital, who requested the supplies, by 30 January.[496] The Gates Foundation stated on 26 January that it would donate US$5 million in aid to support the response in China that will be aimed at assisting "emergency funds and corresponding technical support to help front-line responders".[497] On 5 February, Bill and Melinda further announced a $100 million donation to the WHO, who made an appeal for funding contributions to the international community the same day. The donation will be used to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts along with protecting "at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia."[498]

Japan, in the process of coordinating a plane flight to Wuhan to pick up Japanese nationals in the city, has promised that the plane will first carry into Wuhan aid supplies that Japanese foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi stated will consist of "masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals".[499] On 26 January, the plane arrived in Wuhan, donating its supply of one million face masks to the city.[500] Also among the aid supplies were 20,000 protective suits for medical staff across Hubei donated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.[501]


Tehran's Azadi Tower lights in the colours of the Flag of China to show support
On 28 January, the city of Mito donated 50,000 masks to its sister-city of Chongqing, and on 6 February, the city of Okayama sent 22,000 masks to Luoyang, its sister-city. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party on 10 February, made a symbolic deduction of 5,000 yen from the March salary of every LDP parliamentarian, a total of 2 million yen, to donate to China, with the party's secretary-general, Toshihiro Nikai, stating that "For Japan, when it sees a virus outbreak in China, it is like seeing a relative or neighbour suffering. Japanese people are willing to help China and hope the outbreak will pass as soon as possible."[502]

Other countries have also announced aid efforts. Malaysia announced a donation of 18 million medical gloves to China.[503] The Philippine Red Cross also donated $1.4 million worth of Philippine-made face masks, which were shipped to Wuhan.[504] Turkey dispatched medical equipment,[505] and Germany delivered various medical supplies including 10,000 Hazmat suits.[506] On 19 February, Singapore Red Cross announced that they will send $2.26 million worth of aid to China, consisting of protective material and training.[507]

WHO response measures
The WHO has commended the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic, with Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressing "confidence in China's approach to controlling the epidemic" and calling for the public to "remain calm".[508] The WHO noted the contrast between the 2003 epidemic, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of Lunar New Year holidays."[509]


WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom
On 23 January, in reaction to the central authorities' decision to implement a transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea remarked that while it was "certainly not a recommendation the WHO has made," it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history."[509]

On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Tedros clarified that the PHEIC, in this case, was "not a vote of no confidence in China," but because of the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.[286][510] In response to the implementations of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement."[511]

On 5 February, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to develop those countries which "do not have the systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it were to emerge." Tedros further made statements declaring that "We are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later."[512][513]

On 11 February, the WHO in a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease. On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the entire UN system in the response." A UN Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing co-ordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO states will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak."[514]


WHO representatives holding joint meeting with Tehran administrators
On 14 February, a WHO-led Joint Mission Team with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts to touch ground in China to assist in the domestic management and evaluate "the severity and the transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions to conduct field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural settings."[515]

On 25 February, the WHO declared that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," stating that while it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nonetheless be "in a phase of preparedness."[516] In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there on the same day to assess the situation.[517]

On 28 February, WHO officials said that the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high," its highest level of alert and risk assessment. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for every government on the planet: Wake up. Get ready. This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," urging that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst of it." Ryan further stated that the current data did not warrant public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus."[518]

On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak an official pandemic.[519] The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction."[520]

Impacts
Politics
Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on politics
Some have criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy.[521][522]

A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions. Some experts believe this is likely in a move to protect Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from people's anger over the coronavirus outbreak.[523] Some commentators have suggested that outcry over the disease could be a rare protest against the CPC.[524] Protests in Hong Kong strengthened due to fears of immigration from mainland China.[525] Taiwan has also voiced concern over being included in any travel ban involving the People's Republic of China due to the "one-China policy" and Chinese claims.[526] A few countries have been using the epidemic to build political bridges with Beijing, raising accusations that these countries, which include Cambodia among others, were putting politics before health, attempting to use the outbreak to show tribute to the CPC.[527] Existing tensions between the US and China may have delayed a coordinated effort to combat the outbreak in Wuhan.[528]

The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been heavily affected by the virus.[529] The spread of the virus has raised questions about the future survival of the regime.[530] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying that his country doesn't have access to international markets due to the United States sanctions against Iran.[531]

The coronavirus outbreak in the United States may have been used to affect negatively Donald Trump's chances of re-election at the 2020 United States presidential election.[532] European Union leaders condemned the U.S. decision to restrict travel from Europe to the United States.[533] The outbreak also prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.[534] Some state emergency orders have waived open meeting laws that require the public have physical access to the meeting location, allowing meetings to be held by public teleconference.[535][536] Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened, as South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts".[537][538]

Education

Learners affected by school closures caused by COVID-19 as of 18 March 2020[28]
  Localised school closures
  Country-wide school closures
As of 17 March, more than 960 million children and youth are not attending school because of temporary or indefinite country wide school closures mandated by governments in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19.[28][539][540] 105 countries have shut schools nationwide, affecting students who would normally attend pre-primary to upper-secondary classes. 15 countries have implemented localized school closures to prevent or contain COVID-19, affecting an additional 640 million school children and youth.[541]

Even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs. The disruptions they cause affect people across communities, but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work.[28][542]

In response to school closures caused by COVID-19, UNESCO recommends the use of distance learning programs and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.[541]

Coronavirus fears have led to panic buying of essentials in Singapore and elsewhere, including toilet paper, dried and/or instant noodles, bread, rice, vegetables, disinfectant and rubbing alcohol
The coronavirus outbreak has been attributed to several instances of supply shortages, stemming from: globally increased usage of equipment to fight the outbreaks, panic buying and disruption to factory and logistic operations. The FDA has issued warnings about shortages to drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.[543] Several localities, such as the United States,[544] Italy,[545] and Hong Kong,[546] also witnessed panic buying that led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, inducing supply shortages.[547] The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods.[548] According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold and this demand has led to the increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months.[549][550] This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.[551]

As mainland China is a major economy and a manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. Some analysts have estimated that the economic fallout of the epidemic on global growth could surpass that of the SARS outbreak.[552] One estimate gives a $300+ billion impact on world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[553] Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reportedly "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[554] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.[555][556] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08.[557] All three indexes ended the week down more than 10 percent.[558] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a Negative Outlook.[559] Stocks plunged again based on coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March 2020.[560] Many consider an economic recession to be likely.[561][562][563]


The near-empty arrival hall of Seoul–Incheon International Airport in South Korea on 6 March
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advise of governments against any travel all over the world. As a consequence, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.[564] Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.[565] The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.[566][567] Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.[568] In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.[569][570] These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.[570] Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.[571][572]

Despite the high prevalence of coronavirus cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, both areas have been spared from acute food shortages. Effective measures by China and Italy against the hoarding and illicit trade of critical products have been carried out with success, avoiding acute food shortages that were anticipated in Europe as well as in North America. Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives. Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population. Similar laws exist in Italy, that require food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.[573][574]

Environment
Due to the coronavirus outbreak's impact on travel and industry, many regions experienced a drop in air pollution. Between 1 January and 11 March 2020, the European Space Agency observed a marked decline in nitrous oxide emissions from cars, power plants and factories in the Po Valley region in northern Italy, coinciding with lockdowns in the region.[575] The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air reported that methods to contain the spread of coronavirus, such as quarantines and travel bans, resulted in a 25% reduction of carbon emission in China.[576][577] In the first month of lockdowns, China produced approximately 200 million fewer metric tons of carbon dioxide than the same period in 2019, due to the reduction in air traffic, oil refining, and coal consumption.[577]

Despite a temporary decline in global carbon emissions, the International Energy Agency warned that the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus outbreak may prevent or delay companies from investing in green energy.[578]It has boosted adoption of remote work policies though.[579][580]

Another recent and rapidly accelerating fallout of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, the film industry, and other societal events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, fashion shows and sports.[581][582]

The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, have been cancelled.[581] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attending Mass on Sundays, which is usually required; some churches have made church services available via online livestreaming or television.[583][581] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels, Saint Peter's Square is now empty of Christian pilgrims;[581] on the other hand the Archdiocese of New York, though cancelling services, has left its churches open for prayer.[581] Likewise, the Islamic Society of North America recommended that congregations suspend Friday congregational prayers and gatherings.[581] The Rabbinical Council of America issued a guideline stating that "public gatherings in synagogues and schools should be severely limited" while the Sikh Coalition recommended the cancelling of services at gurdwaras.[581]

The pandemic has caused, at the very least, the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events scheduled to take place now or in the next few weeks have been either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,[584] 2019–20 Premier League,[585] UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season,[586] and 2019–20 NHL season.[587] The outbreak has been a concern for the 2020 Summer Olympics which is scheduled to take place in Tokyo starting at the end of July.[588]

As of 18 March, most casinos and other gaming venues worldwide have been closed indefinitely and many upcoming live poker tournaments have been either postponed, cancelled or (in jurisdictions where currently permitted) moved to an online platform. Tournaments originally scheduled to be played live and now being played online include the 2020 Irish Poker Open. The sudden shut down of live poker has caused a massive surge in online poker traffic. This has been attributed in part to the indefinite closure of most casinos and other live gaming venues worldwide and in part to the sudden dearth of live entertainment options due to the widespread disruption of the sports and entertainment schedules around the world. Many operators reported traffic of double or more the previous volume, depending on the time of day.[citation needed]

The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.[589][590] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.[591] Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts[592] or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute and publicize their work.[593]

Potential long-term impacts
See also: Globalization and disease
The political, cultural, and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic may together cause major changes in human society.[594] They include the rise in remote work, localization of global supply chains, and increased political polarization.[594]

The pandemic has been claimed to be causing a "revolution in working from home" as major corporations have transitioned to telecommuting arrangements in order to slow the spread of the virus.[595] This effect has also been observed in the rise of online learning in higher education.[596] Additionally, there may also be a reduction in business travel and international conferences, with virtual substitutes replacing them.[597]

A more widespread reversal of globalization has also been discussed, especially in regards to supply chains.[598] The German Economy Minister has supported localization of supply chains in reaction to the pandemic.[599]

Xenophobia and racism

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, heightened prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been noted toward people of Chinese and other East Asian descent, as incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries,[601][602][603][604] particularly in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.[605] Some countries in Africa were seeing rising anti-Chinese sentiment as well.[606][607] There has been support for the Chinese, both on and offline towards those in virus-stricken areas,[608][609][610][611] but many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported experiencing discrimination based on their regional origin.[612][613][614] Since the progression of the outbreak to new hot-spot countries, people from Italy, the center of Europe's coronavirus outbreak, have also been subjected to suspicion and xenophobia.[615][616]

Citizens in numerous countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea, have signed petitions lobbying their government to ban Chinese people from entering their country.[617][618][619][620] In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan had been trending on Twitter.[621] Chinese people in the United Kingdom said they were facing increasing levels of racist abuse, with cases of assaults reported.[622][623] Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan.[624] Students from Northeast India, which shares a border with China, who study in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.[625] Local authorities in Bolivia quarantined Japanese nationals despite them having no coronavirus-related symptoms.[626] In the Russian cities of Moscow and Yekaterinburg, Chinese nationals were targeted by quarantine enforcing campaigns, as well as police raids, which were condemned by human rights advocates as racial profiling.[627] The Chinese Embassy in Germany has acknowledged a rise in hostile cases against its citizens since the outbreak.[628] Children of Asian descent were ostracized and mocked over their origins in middle schools near Paris.[629][630] Many French-Vietnamese report also being subject to harassment since the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.[631]

On 30 January, the WHO's Emergency Committee issued a statement advising all countries to be mindful of the "principles of Article 3 of the IHR (the International Health Regulations)," which the WHO says is a caution against "actions that promote stigma or discrimination," when conducting national response measures to the outbreak.[286]

Information dissemination
Open-access papers
Owing to the urgency of the epidemic, many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.[632] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv,[633] while archivists created an open access database of over 5,000 papers about coronaviruses, which they downloaded from Sci-Hub.[634] In addition, the platform Outbreak Science Rapid PREreview was launched to perform rapid open peer review of preprints related to emerging outbreaks.[635]

Medical care providers, including intensivists and pulmonologists, involved in the Free Open Access Medicine movement rapidly compiled both disease information and treatment procedures in the Internet Book of Critical Care which was quickly circulated by institutions including Princeton and UPenn.[636][637][638]

Citizen science
Interactive computing games have also been used to help with "designing and identifying proteins that may be able to bind to and neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that it uses to invade host cells. The scientists hope that players' creations will yield insights that will allow them to create an effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19."[639] Foldit is an online video game that challenges players to fold various proteins into shapes where they are stable: "Players—who can work alone or in teams—are using the game's puzzle system to develop new protein structures that can be tested by biochemists in the lab for use in antiviral drugs."[640] Folding@home developed by the Stanford University is asking people for donating their CPU time for computational drug design and other types of molecular dynamics involving SARS-CoV-2.[641] Rosetta@home run by the Baker laboratory at the University of Washington has been used for the same purpose.[642]

Misinformation
Main article: Misinformation related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic
After the initial outbreak, conspiracy theories and misinformation[643] spread online regarding the origin and scale of the COVID-19 coronavirus.[644] Various social media posts claimed the virus was a bio-weapon, a population control scheme, or the result of a spy operation.[645][646][647]

Facebook, Google and Twitter announced that they would take stringent measures against possible misinformation.[648] In a blog post, Facebook stated they would remove content flagged by leading global health organizations and local authorities that violates its content policy on misinformation leading to "physical harm."[649]

On 2 February, the WHO declared there was a "massive infodemic" accompanying the outbreak and response, citing an overabundance of reported information, accurate and false, about the virus that "makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it." The WHO stated that the high demand for timely and trustworthy information has incentivized the creation of a direct WHO 24/7 myth-busting hotline where its communication and social media teams have been monitoring and responding to misinformation through its website and social media pages.[650][651] The WHO has specifically debunked as false some claims that have circulated on social media, including that a person can tell if they have the virus or not simply by holding their breath; that drinking lots of water will protect against the virus; and that that gargling salt water will prevent infection.[652]

Taiwanese authorities have accused 50 Cent Party's internet trolls of spreading disinformation online to sow fear and panic among Taiwanese.[653][654] According to The Economist, conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down were all over the Chinese internet.[655][656] On 26 January, Chinese military news agency Xilu published an article claiming the virus was artificially combined by the United States to "precisely target Chinese people".[657][658] Zhao Lijian, a spokesman from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, tweeted in March 2020 that the disease may have been introduced by members of the American Army who visited Wuhan in October 2019.[659] On 22 February, US officials said that they have discovered Russia-linked social media accounts deliberately promoting anti-American conspiracy theories, such as "waging economic war" on China,[660][661] which was denied by Russia.[662]Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and some members of the United States Congress have been accused of giving misinformation about the coronavirus.[663][664][665]

According to Radio Farda, Iranian cleric Seyyed Mohammad Saeedi accused President Trump of targeting Qom with coronavirus to fulfil his previous promise of retaliation against Iranian cultural sites.[666] Iranian researcher Ali Akbar Raefipour claimed that the coronavirus was part of a "hybrid warfare" program waged by the United States on Iran and China.[667] Iran's Press TV asserted that "Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran".[668] According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, numerous writers in the Arabic media have promoted the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 was deliberately created and spread by the United States, as "part of an economic and psychological war waged by the US against China with the aim of weakening it and presenting it as a backward country and a source of diseases".[669]

In a move which commentators consider state propaganda to deflect blame for poor handling of the epidemic, some officials, including a foreign ministry spokesman, the state news agency Xinhua, have protested at alleged "politicisation" of the outbreak by countries. Possibly prompted by a press conference on 27 February where Zhong Nanshan, a prominent expert, said that "the coronavirus first appeared in China but may not have originated in China", individual officials have echoed Xinhua's claim that "The WHO has said many times that COVID-19 is a global phenomenon with its source still undetermined."[670][671][672]
