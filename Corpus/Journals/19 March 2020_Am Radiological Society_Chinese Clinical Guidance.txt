The Chinese National Health Commission has published "Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment." The document, in its 7th version and translated by the Chinese Society of Cardiology, reflects deeper understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathological features of the disease and "the accumulation of experience in diagnosis and treatment."

The document reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathology, clinical features and clinical classifications, including in children, of COVID-19. In addition, it provides information on warning signals in adults and children for severe and critical types of COVID-19 and how to differentiate COVID-19 infections and pneumonia from upper respiratory tract infections or other known viral pneumonias.

Clinical guidance is also provided for identifying cases and filing reports, as well as treatment. The document outlines recommendations for general treatment, as well as treatment of severe and critically severe cases, and options for discharge criteria and precautions.
