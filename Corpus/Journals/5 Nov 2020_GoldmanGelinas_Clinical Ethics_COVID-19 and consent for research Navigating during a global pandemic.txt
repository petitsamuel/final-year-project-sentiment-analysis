COVID-19 and consent for research: Navigating during a global pandemic
Ran D Goldman, Luke Gelinas 
Abstract
The modern ethical framework demands informed consent for research participation that includes disclosure of material information, as well as alternatives. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic (COVID-19) results in illness that often involves rapid deterioration. Despite the urgent need to find therapy, obtaining informed consent for COVID-19 research is needed. The current pandemic presents three types of challenges for investigators faced with obtaining informed consent for research participation: (1) uncertainty over key information to informed consent, (2) time and pressure constraints, and (3) obligations regarding disclosure of new alternative therapies and re-consent. To mitigate consenting challenges, primary investigators need to work together to jointly promote urgent care and research into COVID-19. Actions they can take include (1) prior plan addressing ways to incorporate clinical research into clinical practice in emergency, (2) consider patients vulnerable with early deliberation on the consent process, (3) seek Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs), (4) create a collaborative research teams, (5) aim to consent once, despite evolving information during the pandemic, and (6) aim to match patients to a trial that will most benefit them. The COVID-19 pandemic both exacerbates existing challenges and raises unique obstacles for consent that require forethought and mindfulness to overcome. While research teams and clinician-investigators will need to be sensitive to their own contexts and adapt solutions accordingly, they can meet the challenge of obtaining genuinely informed consent during the current pandemic.

Keywords COVID-19, consent, pandemic
Background
Biomedical research with human participants often involves high impact clinical trials, and the modern ethical framework demands informed consent for research participation. The decision to participate in research, taken by a competent individual, requires disclosure of necessary or material information, as well as alternatives. It also requires adequate understanding of this information, and voluntarily arriving at a decision without having been subjected to coercion, undue influence or inducement, or intimidation.1

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that started spreading in humans in the end of 2019, now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a global pandemic that has affected millions of people.2 The death toll from this pandemic has been considerable and has surpassed previous global pandemics, including the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS). Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, often involving rapid deterioration necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation.3

Given the gap in knowledge about COVID-19 and its devastating health, social, and economic consequences, it is imperative to conduct scientifically rigorous clinical research evaluating potential prevention, mitigating therapies, and supportive treatment options. This need has been generally well recognized, with governments and industry sponsors funding numerous urgent initiatives to study the condition and its implications, largely in sick patient populations.4,5

Despite the urgent need for quick advances in COVID-19 treatment, the ethical imperative to obtain informed consent remains. Valid informed consent for research participation requires both adequate disclosure of key features of the research by a person seeking consent, including information relevant to the condition and intervention offered, be it experimental drug, procedure or device, and adequate comprehension of that information and a voluntary decision to participate by the person giving consent. A number of factors, however, complicate both sides of this equation in the emerging field of COVID-19 clinical research. In addition, systemic factors also present challenges. Here we consider several challenges for investigators, patient-participants, and systemic factors and offer practical points to consider for navigating them.

Challenges for investigators
The current pandemic presents at least three types of challenges for investigators faced with obtaining informed consent for research participation: (1) uncertainty over key information to informed consent, (2) time and pressure constraints, and (3) obligations regarding disclosure of new alternative therapies and re-consent.

Uncertainty
Given the novelty of the virus, there is profound uncertainty about the nature of COVID-19, its impact on humans, and best therapies. The evidence-base evolves daily, with new information on epidemiological transmission, symptomatology, determining risk factors for abridged outcomes, and genetic aspects of morbidity and mortality. This rapid rate of change makes it difficult to assess the potential impact of alternative therapies, determining which drug classes or mechanisms of action may be promising, and how different types of drugs may interact with each other.

One of the basic elements for informed consent is the description of any foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject, an estimate of their likelihood, and a description of what steps will be taken to prevent or minimize them.6 While all research involving investigational therapies carries unknown risks, the fact that so little research has been conducted on COVID-19 sets it apart from other areas of study, where there are typically animal models and earlier clinical trials in the same or similar disease populations. The lack of such background for much COVID-19 research makes it difficult to assess how experimental drugs, devices or procedures may affect subjects, even when such interventions are approved for other indications and significant safety knowledge has been previously obtained about them in non-COVID populations.7

For example, the distribution, maturation, and functioning of viral receptors is frequently mentioned as a possible reason for difference in incidence and symptomatology of COVID-19. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as the cell receptor in humans.8 For many patients with cardiovascular comorbidities who are prescribed angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy,9 investigators will find it challenging to provide accurate information on their continued risks or benefits. Similarly, the risks and benefits of using these pharmacotherapies for treatment of COVID-19 for those with normal blood pressure or other cardiovascular-related conditions are yet to be determined.

Alternatives and re-consent
In addition to disclosing risks, informed consent for clinical research also requires the disclosure of relevant alternatives that might be advantageous to the individual.6,10 In the context of COVID-19, where there are no approved treatments, the relevant alternatives may include only supportive care, or also the off-label use of other available therapies. In addition, while we do not believe clinicians have an obligation to disclose alternative clinical trial opportunities, they may be relied on by patients to make recommendations about whether a clinical trial, as opposed to interventions available outside research, is a good option for patients. Moreover, clinicians may also be asked to make recommendations between multiple clinical trials, given the proliferation of COVID-19 studies. Clinical uncertainty and the rapidly evolving evidence-base make it challenging for clinicians and researchers to base recommendations in these situations.

The process of re-consent can be defined as an action in which a subject (or representative) makes a decision about whether to re-affirm a previous choice to participate in research.11 Re-consent should include disclosure of any new, potentially material findings that have emerged since initial consent.6 In addition to uncertainty over which developments are important enough to disclose, here again the rapidly changing evidence base may make it difficult for researchers to remain up to speed on new developments. Examples of a need to re-consent may be a newly approved therapy for COVID-19 (hence an alternative to participation), new information on therapy offered in the trial that was discovered during treatment of prior subjects. With daily changes in understanding of the disease, and hundreds of weekly publications focused on the topic, it may also be unclear how often such disclosure and re-consent should take place. This challenge may be further magnified by rapidly expanding opportunities for access to products granted Emergency Use Authorizations, as well as emerging clinical trial opportunities.

Challenges for patient-participants
Because patient understanding depends on clear and robust disclosure from researchers, many of the obstacles that make it challenging for clinicians and researchers, to meet their disclosure obligations in the context of COVID-19, also hinder patient comprehension and robust informed consent. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 on patient cognitive status and the potentially vulnerable nature raise further challenges.

Risk of clouded decision making
Similar to other types of emergency research, subjects considering participation in COVID-19 clinical trials may be considered vulnerable.12 While the research community should aim to fully honor the autonomy of all patients with COVID-19, those with moderate and severe illness may experience diminished capacity, due to the nature of symptoms and need for mechanical ventilation under sedation. In addition, the stressful state of being sick with the viral infection, in the face of intensive media coverage and the change in daily life activities for communities worldwide, may be unsettling, invite anxiety, and further cloud decision-making. Patients frequently make their decisions on participation in trials based on the way information is presented to them verbally, rather than reading a written consent form,13 and clinicians’ time constraints during the pandemic may limit the ability to sufficiently provide this need for patients, further compromising their informed consent. Moreover, patients’ perceptions of the manner and content of information disclosure are influenced by more general attitudes towards medical care, research, and institutions.14 At a time where clinical facilities are facing unsettling pressures,15 such as overburdened emergency departments, staff shortages due to contracting illness, and long wait times for patients to be seen, the quality of the informed consent process may be less than optimal.

Legally authorized representatives
During the COVID-19 illness, family centered care—the notion that families of patients should be an integral part of their care - is likely of greater importance than in other times.16 Many patients may benefit from family input during the consent process, but public health risks may preclude in-person family consultation. Further, many patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 will be incapacitated, or on the verge of being unable to consider and consent for a trial. Research participation for these individuals may require a legally authorized representative (LAR) to consent on their behalf. This places further strains on clinicians as well as the health system, as locating appropriate LARs and engaging them in robust consent is often difficult due to time and other constraints.17

Systemic challenges
The surge of sick and hospitalized patients due to COVID-19, many acutely ill and in need of resource- and time-intensive care, places unprecedented strains on health care systems. Participation in research needs to be voluntary and free of coercion, and the consent must ensure that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits. Considering participation in research should allow ample time for prospective subjects to consider their best interests.

Pandemic conditions and timely therapies
There is a clear and palpable need to find therapies for the new illness threatening millions of lives worldwide. All partners in the research ecosystem need to work in tandem to initiate, conduct and complete trials. From Sponsors to local sites and investigators, Institutional Review Board (IRB) committees, funding agencies and regulators – all must function together with new processes in mind, removing barriers to initiation of research and inclusion of patients. Subjects are part of the ecosystem and may need to consider their participation urgently, limiting the timeframe to decide on participation and for signing the informed consent form. While subjects (or their legally acceptable representative) must feel that they had adequate time to review and discuss the research despite COVID-19 rapid clinical deterioration of patients,18 the stress on the medical system,19 and the need for rapid accrual of patients.

Limited resources
With exceptionally limited research personnel available in clinical settings,20 clinicians may find themselves in circumstances where they serve as investigators and conduct the research consent process. Whether familiar with the role, or novel clinical-researchers, medical staff needs to prioritize clinical care, using COVID-19 strict clinical protocols that may hinder timely, accurate and comprehensive research consent process.

Mitigating consenting challenges
Health research has high value to society during the COVID-19 pandemic and has the ability to find safe and effective therapies that will save lives and bring comfort to those suffering. It may very likely help determine public health interventions, and how care will be delivered in the foreseeable future. Clinicians turned investigators, as well as Primary Investigators (PI) and their teams need to work together to jointly promote urgent care and research into COVID-19.

Make a Plan – in the hectic clinical setting when managing sick patients with COVID-19, clinical care takes precedence over research activities. Sites that want to participate in COVID-19 research need to have a prior plan addressing ways to incorporate clinical research into their clinical practice in emergency departments, intensive care units, clinics, and long term facilities, in a way that will not compromise care.

Consider Patients Vulnerable – COVID-19 patients in moderate to severe clinical condition should be considered vulnerable. While full autonomy should be pursued for all patients, early deliberation on the consent process, before any deterioration is notable, should take place. Stressors associated with the pandemic, including social distancing and the likelihood of debilitating symptoms, should be considered. Effort should be made to conduct a consent process with family members, using advance video technology for those who cannot attend the clinical space. Whenever possible, obtaining consent should be done after limiting unsettling pressures (noise, distracting commotion).

Seek Legally Authorized Representatives - With limited visitation in hospitals21 and mounting pressures on patients and staff, early determination of potential and applicable LARs will allow patients to participate in COVID-19 research if they deteriorate. While research into risk factors for deterioration [18] has been less than optimal so far, determining LAR when patients are in full capacity will support research into COVID-19 therapies. Research staff should consider virtual connectivity, especially with 2-way video and inclusion of the patient if possible, in that conversation. The process should be considered sufficient to ensure potential LARs understand the full scope of the role.

Create a Research Team – Sponsor’s partnership with hospital staff, administrators, Institutional Review Board (IRB) and local or federal regulators need to be considering team work, to try and urgently overcome restrictions that extended research approval pre-pandemic. This does not mean that investigators can “cut corners”, but since COVID-19 research is time-intensive, research and ethical cogwheels need to work in tandem with the objective of finding cure and societal benefit from new therapies. Furthermore, local sites must find innovative and efficient ways to assess all COVID-19 patients for potential trials in order to see COVID-19 studies completion as fast as possible.

Consenting Once – while unearthing new knowledge on COVID-19 occurs daily, alerting consented subjects to every new piece of information, or re-consenting them, is not feasible or warranted, since interpretation of the new data may be challenging to the PI just as much as to the consented subject. Offering other trials, when there is no standard of care or approved therapies, will not allow completing trials that started and may delay potential therapies or defer discovering harmful treatments. Listing trials as an alternative in a consent form is also not practical or needed. At the time of writing this article almost a thousand COVID-19 trials were listed in CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, and cataloging relevant other trials in the consent form will be confusing. Yet, Sponsors and PIs must be alert to the most recent information related to COVID-19, initiation of, or early termination of, other studies due to safety signals.22 Honest and safe research practice will not only ensure proper conduct of trials during the pandemic, but will help build public trust in the medical research endeavour for future generations.

Right Patient in the Right Trial - matching COVID-19 patients to a trial that will most benefit to them, or that will offer the least risk to them is an art yet to be taught. Without clear knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of action or the interaction of old and new therapies with the virus, robust inclusion and exclusion criteria and solid screening are needed. This may include evaluation of concomitant medications subjects are prescribed or allowed to use during the trial. Close monitoring of trials is critical in order to ensure adverse events and drug interactions are established early, assessed during the trial and brought to data safety monitoring committees promptly. Study approval and initiation is just the beginning and majority of the work needs to be invested in ensuring safety of current subjects and future patients.

Conclusion
In the best of times, obtaining genuinely informed consent for research can be challenging.

The COVID-19 pandemic both exacerbates existing challenges and raises unique obstacles for consent that require forethought and mindfulness to overcome. We have identified several such challenges and laid out a set of actionable recommendations for overcoming them. While research teams and clinician-investigators will need to be sensitive to their own contexts and adapt solutions to accordingly, we hope that the framework we provide here will help them meet the challenge of obtaining genuinely informed consent during the current pandemic.
