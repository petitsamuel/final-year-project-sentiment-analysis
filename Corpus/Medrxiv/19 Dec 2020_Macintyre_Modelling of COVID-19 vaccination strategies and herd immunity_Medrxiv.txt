Abstract: Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is likely to be limited, and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile of 1 million doses in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented pandemic, with
catastrophic health, social and economic impacts 1
. Without available drugs or vaccines,
nations require ongoing or intermittent use of non-pharmaceutical approaches such as
lockdowns, border closures and social distancing to control COVID-192,3
. In addition, case
finding through increased testing and surveillance, with contact tracing and quarantine, are
the mainstays of epidemic control 4 . While Australia has achieved good control over the pandemic through border closures, testing, contact tracing and hotel quarantine, the risk of intermittent outbreaks of COVID-19 will continue until an effective vaccine is available 3 . The societal impact of ongoing restrictions and border closure cannot be under-estimated.
There is a massive global effort to fast-track the development of COVID-19 vaccines
5,6
.
Currently, there are 48 COVID-19 vaccine candidates undergoing clinical evaluation, with 11
already in phase 3 clinical trials 7
. Preliminary reports from phase 3 trials suggest that mRNA
vaccines have over 90% efficacy against COVID-19 infection 8,9
. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the
largest component of the planned Australian vaccine stockpile, has efficacy of 62% against
symptomatic infection in the intended two-dose schedule 10
. On December 11 it was
announced that the second largest component of the Australian stockpile had been
withdrawn from further development 11
. A small proportion of the Australian vaccine plan
includes the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, which has 95% efficacy against symptomatic
infection 11,12
. As more vaccine candidates become available through 2021, we will continue
to see variation in efficacy and safety between them.
It is likely there will be initial vaccine shortages. Thus, an effective vaccination strategy will
need to be developed to best utilise limited vaccine supply in the early phases of vaccine
rollout 13, with a plan for expanded vaccination at a later stage.
Several COVID-19 vaccination strategies have been proposed,
13 such as prioritising
healthcare and aged care workers and other frontline responders at high risk of disease
transmission, and sociodemographic groups at significantly higher risk of severe disease,
such as older adults or people with high risk chronic health conditions 13,14. However,
prioritizing children or young people may impact transmission more, since vaccines are
more effective in younger people, and transmission is highest in young adults15

Alternatively, a ring vaccination strategy could be utilized, which involves identifying the
close contacts of a confirmed case and vaccinating them. This strategy was used effectively
against Ebola, and also smallpox in settings where mass vaccination was not possible,
despite efficacy being half that of primary prevention 16–19
. Many vaccines including
measles, hepatitis A and smallpox, are effective as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and can
be given to contacts during an outbreak, albeit with lower efficacy than primary prevention
20
. Whether COVID-19 vaccines will be effective as PEP is unknown as yet, but may well be
given the long incubation period 21
.
In Australia, the stated priority groups for early COVID-19 vaccination are: 1) individuals
with increased risk of severe disease, such as older adults, Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander people, and those with high risk chronic conditions; 2) individuals at higher risk of
disease, such as health and aged care workers; and 3) individuals working in critical services
22. The aim of this paper was to model the impact of various COVID-19 vaccine strategies
under a limited supply scenario, as well as varied vaccine efficacy and speed of vaccination
for mass vaccination, on COVID-19 case numbers and mortality in New South Wales, the
most populous state of Australia.
Methods
A previously published age structured deterministic compartmental model for Covid-19
spread 23 was modified to test several possible vaccination strategies under limited or
unlimited supply assumptions, as described in more detail below. We used the NSW
population and age distribution from 2020 24, stratified into 16 five-year age groups from 0
to 74 years old and the last age group comprising people 75 years and over.
The model moves the population in 16 mutually exclusive compartments, each divided by
the 17 age groups: susceptible (S), latent, not infectious (E), pre-symptomatic infectious and
diagnosed (Et
), pre-symptomatic infectious and undiagnosed (Eu
), contacts traced (C)
symptomatic, high infectiousness, diagnosed (I1) and undiagnosed (I2), asymptomatic, high
infectiousness (A1), symptomatic, lower infectiousness, previous diagnosed (I11) and
undiagnosed (I22), asymptomatic low infectiousness (A2), home isolated (Q), hospitalized
(H), individuals admitted to intensive care (ICU) , recovered (R), successfully vaccinated (V)

and COVID-19 deceased people (D). The duration of stay in each compartment determines
the rate at which people move from one compartment to another for the epidemiological
disease states. The duration of the latent period is assumed to be 5.2 days 25, of which the
last two days before symptoms onset are considered infectious 26
.
The transmission was distributed over the infectious period with 44 % of transmissions
occurring in the last two days of the pre-symptomatic state. We assume that the viral load is
very high on the first day of symptoms and then decreases to a lower infectious level,
spread over the following 6 days 26, so 36% of transmissions occur in the first day of
symptoms and 20% in the following 6 days of symptoms 26. Of the total people infected,
35% are considered asymptomatic and never develop symptoms, however we assumed that
asymptomatic cases are as equally infectious as symptomatic ones 27–29. In conjunction with
vaccination, other disease control interventions such as case finding, contacts tracing,
quarantine, isolation and hospital, ICU treatments were included, however we did not
include additional measures such as universal masking or lockdowns, neither of which are in
effect in NSW.
The force of infection that moves people from susceptible to infected is an age specific rate
calculated as a combination of average age specific number of close contacts per day in
Australia 30, the proportion of infectious people and the probability of infection per contact,
which is estimated to reproduce an R0 of 2.5 28
. Once infected, a person enters the latent
compartment, and after 3.2 days will become infectious and pre-symptomatic for 2 days,
where if traced will be quarantined with a 50% reduction in transmissions 31 and upon
symptoms onset will take 1 day on average to get isolated with no more transmissions after
isolation. However, if an infected person is not traced in latency, it will take 5 days to get
isolated following symptom onset 32
. Hospitalizations and admission to ICU follow agespecific rates 33. The model assumes that 80% of all close contacts are traced and
quarantined for 14 days and 90% of the symptomatic cases are isolated after 5 days.
There are no data on COVID-19 vaccines as PEP, but early data from phase three trials
indicate efficacy in excess of 90% as primary prevention of mRNA vaccines 8
. Vaccine
efficacy was set at 90% in the base case scenario if a person is susceptible and 45% if the
vaccine is given in the early latent epidemiological state as PEP. All parameters used in the
model, as well as differential equations are described in the supplementary materials.

In order to test the most effective vaccination distribution for outbreak control, we used a
hypothetical epidemic in NSW with 100 symptomatic people and 250 untraced latent
infected people as the starting conditions, so that we could test the effectiveness of
different vaccination strategies in an epidemic scenario.
Vaccination strategies tested
1. Limited vaccine supply (1 million doses) given to targeted age groups
2. Limited vaccine supply, ring vaccination (contact tracing and vaccination of contacts)
3. Unlimited supply and mass vaccination assuming enough doses to vaccinate the
entire NSW population
In the limited supply scenario, we assumed a limited stock of only 2 million doses (for 1
million people in a two-dose schedule) for NSW as an estimate of initial supply. For mass
vaccination we assumed a delivery capacity of 50,000-300,000 doses per day 34. We
explored 3 different scenarios with a limited vaccine supply:
1) Vaccine delivered in 8 days to 1 million young people (age group 10-29);
2) Vaccine delivered in 8 days (first dose) to 1 million older people (age group 65+);
3) Vaccinate 125,000 HCWs with first dose and over the following 7 days 875,000
people aged 10-29;
The two dose schedule was assumed to be given with 21-28 days between dose one and
two. 10,12
 The health care workers (HCWs) for NSW were estimated from the 2019
estimation State and Territory Statistics – 2019 35 and were assumed to be 3 times more
susceptible to infection with COVID-19 36
. The number of medical practitioners, nurses,
midwives, and pharmacists in NSW is 135,379 – we assumed 80-90% wold be in the clinical
workforce and require vaccination (125,000 vaccinations). As their average age is
respectively 47, 44 and 41 years old 35, we distributed them through 8 age groups from 25
to 64 years old, following the age distribution of HCWs.
For ring vaccination we assumed varying proportions of vaccination of all the traced
contacts - 70%, 80% and 90%. For use as PEP, we assumed a 50% reduction in efficacy (from
90% to 45%) when given to latent pre-symptomatic people.

For mass vaccination in NSW, assuming that the vaccine supply is available for the
population, we tested the effect of speed of achieving high coverage by comparing the
capacity to deliver 50,000, 75,000, 100,000, 125,000, and 300,000 doses per day to
vaccinate the NSW population. We also varied the efficacy of the vaccine to determine the
minimum vaccine efficacy to achieve herd immunity, and the epidemic scenario with low
and high efficacy vaccines. We used the following formula to calculate the required vaccine
coverage (Vc) for herd immunity assuming R0=2.5.
28 In the base case, vaccine efficacy (Ve) =
0.9 (90%).
Vc =
1
Ve
? (1 ?

)
To test the effect of varied efficacy, vaccine coverage was held constant at 70%, reflecting a
feasible mass vaccination goal. We tested varied vaccine efficacy of 38%, 50%, 60%, 70%,
80%, 90% and 95%. These estimates were selected based on published upper efficacy of
vaccines of 94-95% 9,10,12, and the remaining values to reflect a plausible efficacy range of
forthcoming vaccines. The lower estimate of 38% is the efficacy against any laboratory
confirmed infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) calculated from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
vaccine (AZD1222) published data, excluding the data from the Brazilian component of the
study, because weekly testing for infection was not done in Brazil.
10
Model outputs are the epidemic curve (cases), total number of cases and deaths and, for
ring and mass vaccination, there is the added output of total number of vaccine doses used
and days to vaccinate the entire susceptible population, respectively.

Results
A restricted supply (for 1 million people) will not be enough to control the epidemic, with all
scenarios resulting in a large number of cases and deaths after 500 days. Figure 1 shows
results for the choice of using the available doses in the age group 10-29 years old,
vaccinating HCWs and then 10-29 years old, or vaccinating the 65+ years old. Targeting the
younger age group will have more impact on reducing the number of cases, whilst
vaccinating people 65+ will have more impact on deaths, as this age group is at much higher
risk of death.

left to right is the epidemic curve, the cumulative case and deaths numbers by targeted age
group vaccinated
If enough vaccine is available to vaccinate the entire population of NSW, the important
variables influencing the results will vaccine efficacy and the speed of vaccination. In Figure
2 we show results of varying vaccination capacity from 50,000, to 300,000 people per day.
Vaccinating 50,000 people per day will take about 177 days to vaccinate the entire
population with one dose, will result in a much longer and larger epidemic, compared to
125,000 or 300,000 people per day. However, if the health system has capacity to vaccinate
at least 75,000 people per day the epidemic could be terminated rapidly (Figure 2).

With a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 90%, vaccinating 66% of the total population (approximately
5.384 million people) will provide herd immunity and reduce the R0 to less than 1. A
minimum VE of 85% is required to achieve herd immunity at 70% population coverage. A VE
of 80% will require 75% of the population to be vaccinated, and VE of 60% will require
100% of the population to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. Table 1 shows the

In Figure 4 the results for ring vaccination with varying rates of contact tracing per day (70%,
80% or 90% of contacts of cases) are shown. The higher the proportion of contacts traced
and vaccinated from the start, the lower the required vaccine doses. If only 70% of contacts
are traced, the required vaccine doses are much higher and the epidemic impact much
greater than 80 or 90% (Figure 3).

Table 2 shows all numerical results for the different scenario tested. In conclusion, with a
limited vaccine stockpile the most efficient way to delivery vaccine doses will be ring
vaccination, assuming a 45% efficacy when used as PEP, and at least 90% of contacts per
case traced and vaccinated. If supply of vaccine is adequate to cover the entire NSW
population, mass vaccination with a high efficacy vaccine and rapid uptake (at least 75,000
people vaccinated per day) will be the only strategy able to achieve herd immunity and
prevent community transmission.

Discussion
We showed that herd immunity through vaccination is the only means to preventing
sustained community transmission and requires mass vaccination of 66% of the population
with a vaccine of 90% efficacy. Vaccines of lower efficacy require higher vaccination
coverage – 100% if the VE is only 60%. Vaccines with less than 60% efficacy cannot achieve
herd immunity. Mass vaccination with a high efficacy vaccine represents the best strategy
for economic recovery, as herd immunity through effective vaccination will provide the best
prospect for lifting of societal restrictions. Elimination cannot be achieved and sustained
without mass vaccination 37
.
We show that for a population of 7.5 million people, if faced with an initial restriction in
vaccine supply, sustained epidemic control cannot be achieved by vaccination alone, and
other non-pharmaceutical interventions will need to continue to mitigate the risk of
outbreaks
2
.If COVID-19 vaccines have efficacy as PEP, contact tracing and ring vaccination is
the best way to achieve epidemic control, but the majority of the population will remain
non-immune and susceptible to outbreaks. Recurrent breaches in hotel quarantine 38 and
associated with cruise ships have resulted in community transmission, and without herd
immunity, this risk will continue and will hamper economic recovery 39
.
During the period of initial restricted supply, health and aged care workers should be the
highest priority, as protecting health workers and other first responders is essential for
health system resilience in a pandemic. During a large second wave in the state of Victoria,
over 3500 health and aged care workers became infected 40, and we demonstrated ongoing
risk to health workers, even during periods of low community incidence 36
. After vaccinating
health and aged care workers, the evidence supports vaccination of older adults. Age is the
strongest predictor of morbidity and mortality, far more than any chronic disease 41
, so
protecting older adults will prevent the most deaths from COVID-19. Including younger
people in the prioritisation group can reduce transmission and the overall infection rates,
although this benefit is negated by the higher mortality rates in older people. Those findings
are supported from a preprint study, which explored the most effective age-group to
prioritize for vaccination in order to reduce morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 42

If COVID-19 vaccines are effective as PEP, this will be the best approach for epidemic control
using a limited vaccine supply and requires capacity for high levels of contact tracing. If
community transmission of COVID-19 remains low, complete contact tracing and ring
vaccination will be a highly cost-effective, dose-sparing strategy. Whilst there are no data
yet on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines as PEP, we showed that if a 50% reduction of
efficacy is seen with these vaccines, that ring vaccination can be an effective strategy, and
may be a better use of a restricted supply initially, if rates of contact tracing are high. Many
vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis in outbreak settings, including measles,
hepatitis A, varicella zoster and smallpox, with an efficacy of 50-90% of that for primary
prevention 20
. This is a research gap for COVID-19 vaccines, which needs to be addressed. If
a high (>80%) percentage of contacts cannot be traced (such as when an epidemic is very
large and the scale of contact tracing is unmanageable, as occurred in the second wave in
the State of Victoria 43, mass vaccination becomes more urgent.
We showed that for mass vaccination, a slow trickle approach will leave us living with
COVID-19 longer with all the associated societal and economic implications - rapid speed of
vaccination will be the best strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality. The logistics of rapid
delivery is key, and we show that slower uptake will result in more cases and deaths and a
longer epidemic risk. Rapid vaccine uptake requires concerted planning for vaccination
infrastructure, including training more accredited vaccinators, planning mass vaccination
clinics, and testing the capacity to deliver 300,000 or more vaccine doses a day, which
provides the best outcomes. We assumed in the base case scenario for mass vaccination
that the health system will be able to deliver 125,000 doses per day, which is similar to the
distribution capacity estimated in Victoria of about 117,000 doses per day 44
. We showed
that the speed of Covid-19 vaccine uptake is critical to rapid epidemic control, however the
logistics of vaccine distribution is complex 44, particularly for a country such Australia, where
an estimated 29% of the population lives in rural and remote areas 45
. Therefore,
development of detailed logistical plans and tools to support increased capacity to
vaccinate, as well as effective vaccine transport, storage, and continuous cold-chain
monitoring is required.

No country has attempted mass vaccination since the eradication of smallpox. Currently in
Australia, vaccination is delivered mainly in primary care. Under the National Immunisation
Program about 5 million doses are delivered across the country each year in the infant,
adolescent and adult vaccination programs. Mass vaccination requires this to be scaled up
by five times. Nurse vaccinators can add to the primary care capacity of general
practitioners but require accredited training to be able to vaccinate. In addition, pharmacists
can vaccinate for influenza in Australia and may be an additional source of accredited
vaccinators, but giving a new vaccine with uncertain safety profile for rare adverse events
would be best done in general practice or in public vaccination clinics staffed by medical and
nursing personnel. Modelling of GP capacity to rapidly vaccinate 70-80% of the population,
and the impact on other medical care, is needed, and logistic support and resourcing for
GPS to expand their capacity to achieve this will be required. This includes cold chain
infrastructure for vaccines that require deep freezing 12
. Decisions need to be made on
public vaccination clinics, staffing, training of more nurse vaccinators and other measures to
increase vaccination capacity.
Australia does not have a goal of herd immunity through mass vaccination at this stage,
which means uptake will not likely be adequate for herd immunity. A vaccine with 90% VE
requires 66% coverage, which is feasible, even without children being vaccinated. At this
stage, because of lack of phase three clinical trial data in children, initial vaccine roll out will
be restricted to adults, who comprise 80% of the population. This also makes age-based
targeted vaccination only feasible for older adults. However, adult vaccination is more
challenging than infant vaccination, as adults are a mobile population – for people over 65
years, about 70% receive influenza vaccine annually. 46 Achieving whole-of-life vaccination
rates above 70% may be challenging, and impossible while COVID-19 vaccines remain
unlicensed in children, who comprise 20% of the population. This is another impetus for
choosing a vaccine with at least 90% VE, as the required coverage for herd immunity (66%)
is far more feasible, even if children are not vaccinated.
Vaccine hesitancy may also affect the ability to achieve rapid, high uptake and must also be
addressed well in advance of vaccination programs to ensure that programmatic
competency to achieve high uptake rapidly will not be met by unexpected social or
behavioral obstacles. Australia has very high rates of vaccination for National Immunization

Program vaccines 47
, especially with the use of financial disincentives, and has a more
accepting culture of public health interventions, so large scale vaccine refusal is not
expected. We also identified that vaccine hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines mostly does
not reflect fixed objection to vaccination, and that there is scope and need for health
promotion and positive messaging to ensure high vaccine uptake 48
.
In conclusion, restricted vaccine supply can protect first responders but will not have an
impact on epidemic control, unless the vaccine has some efficacy as PEP. If vaccines are
effective as PEP, then vaccinating health workers and ring vaccination would be the
preferred use of a restricted supply. We recommend that clinical trials urgently be
conducted to study the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines as PEP given to close contacts of
cases. When vaccine supply is available for mass vaccination, the quicker a high uptake can
be achieved, the greater the impact on epidemic control, morbidity and mortality, but herd
immunity cannot be achieved with vaccines of less than 60 % efficacy. The VE of the
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the largest component of the Australian planned stockpile, is
less than 40% against any laboratory confirmed infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic)
based on interim analysis. 10 The use of high efficacy vaccines provides the only prospect of
achieving herd immunity against SARS-COV-2, and such vaccines should be procured if herd
immunity is a goal. There are no data on serial dosing with two different vaccines, which is a
possible scenario if Australia starts with a lower efficacy vaccine. This is another reason to
ensure adequate supply of high efficacy vaccines. The logistics of mass vaccination, including
cold chain, delivery, capacity to vaccinate and addressing vaccine hesitancy should be a high
priority for planning and resourcing.

Supplementary information - Modelling of COVID-19 vaccination strategies and herd
immunity, in scenarios of limited and full vaccine supply in NSW, Australia.
Model Description
We used three different model structures to simulate targeted, mass and ring vaccination
strategies. Matlab 2019 software was used to build deterministic compartmental disease
transmission models. We used an expanded SEIR system of ordinary differential equations,
where the population (the initial susceptible) is divided in 16 age groups, 5 years each from 0
years old to 74 years old and an additional age group comprising people 75+ years old.
Furthermore, the population is divided in two groups, health care workers (HCWs) and
general population, to take into account the higher infection risk for HCWs. The differential
equations move the population through diseases epidemiological stages, as susceptible (S),
latent not infectious yet (E) latent infectious undiagnosed (Eu
), contacts traced and isolated
for 14 days (C), symptomatic infectious stages for undiagnosed (I1,I11) and diagnosed
(I2,I22), recovered (R) or death (D), and public health response stages, as latent infectious
diagnosed (Et
) or isolated (Q), cases hospitalized (H) and requiring intensive care unit (ICU),
and the vaccinated compartment (V). The H and ICU outputs are not shown in the outputs,
but are assumed to have reduced transmission risk in the model once cases are isolated. We
have two compartments for asymptomatic people, (A1 and A2). A1 represent the peak of
infectiousness and A2 the 6 following days of gradually decreasing infectivity.
The force of infection, which is the age specific rates at which susceptible people get infected
is described as

Targeted and mass vaccination models
For the implementation of targeted and mass vaccination strategy for outbreak response we
used the same model structure, however we used different matrix Xj,i for vaccination rates
between each targeted strategy and mass vaccination. In the scenario of age-targeted
vaccination, we included only susceptible people and the vaccine distribution rates are
constantly distributed equally every day to the same targeted age group until the available
stockpile is finished. For mass vaccination the distribution rates in age groups and
epidemiological state are directly proportional to the number of susceptible and latent people
each day.
If Mj,i is the matrix by 2 epidemiological states (S and E) and by 16 age groups, containing all
the population susceptible and latent who will get vaccinated, and Xj,i is the same size matrix
of vaccine distribution rates, each element , of the matrix Xj,i is recalculated each day as an
endogenously estimated parameter, which depends on the number of people in each of the
compartments , of the matrix Mj,i. In formula each element , of the distribution matrix
Xj,i is recalculated every day as
