Nissan was however disappointed with the first style as they sensed the car was regarded too &amp;quot;retro&amp;quot; or too &amp;quot;backward&amp;quot; just like a innovative 240Z thus a upgrade was going. The remodeled style, now known as the Z Concept, which was identical in bodyshape but with a remodeled front side end was revealed at the Detroit Motor Show two years after the first.

Costs began in the US$26k variety for a Base, and went beyond US$34k for the Track style. Nissan's performance and motorsport category, Nismo, began generating performance and cosmetic improvements for the 350Z quickly after its launch.
           In 2004, Nissan presented the 350Z Roadster edition. The roadster came in 2 reduce offers, the Fanatic and Visiting versions. Again, in the UK &amp;amp; European countries, this was restricted to a Platform and GT load up choice, with the inclusion of the Aero Seating.
           In 2005, Nissan provided the 35th Anniversary edition. The 2005 35th Anniversary edition (6-speed guide only; the automated was restricted to 287 hp) and 2005 Track cuts both generate 300 hp (224 kW) - exactly twice the result of the unique 1969 Datsun 240Z.

These changes cause to a rise in the engine's power, and a next improve of redline to 6400 rpm instead of 6200rpm. Although there were improves in power, the changes cause to a loss of overall twisting in the car.
           Nissan also provided the Grand Touring reduce to the Roadster reduce offers for 2005. Since the anniversary edition, all 6-speed models are now the 300 hp/260 ft•lbf.
