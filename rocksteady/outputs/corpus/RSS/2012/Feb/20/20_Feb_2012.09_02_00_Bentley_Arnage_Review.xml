The powertrain changes are associated by simple outside, internal and under-bonnet style hints.

In the performance-oriented Arnage T model, the enhanced twin-turbocharged V8 website makes a incredible 500bhp and 1000Nm of twisting – an 11percent improve in power and a 14 percent improve in twisting over the outbound model. Twinned with the latest six-speed ZF automated gear box, which uses state-of-the-art pc control, efficiency and accomplishment are optimized at all connections. In the

          &lt;B&gt;Arnage &lt;/B&gt;T requirements, 500bhp and 1000Nm of twisting - results that make sure that the famous Bentley trend of twisting is even more unbelievable than before. Top rate of the Arnage T has increased from 168mph/270km/h to 179mph/288km/h, while the 450bhp Arnage R and RL’s maximum rate improves by 13mph/21km/h to 168mph/270km/h.
