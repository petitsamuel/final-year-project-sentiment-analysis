          &lt;A href="http://carsgrid.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Koenigsegg Agera R&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt; on the Koenigsegg show stand - generation car # 83 - is motivated by the famous Speed Racer style, as specified by the owner of the car. Speed Racer main color is white - so is snowfall. Outfitted with special Michelin wheels and a personalized Thule Roof Box - Speed Racer is ready to invasion the ski resorts!
           In 2010 Koenigsegg provided a pre-production edition of the 
          &lt;A href="http://carsgrid.blogspot.com/2012/02/koenigsegg-agera-r.html"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Koenigsegg Agera R&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt;. Since then the pre-production car and several analyze high heel mules have ongoing the Agera development program. The Agera pre-production car has been pushed by several powerful driving magazines, leading to talk opinions and prizes, such as for example becoming the &amp;quot;Top Gear Hypercar of the Year&amp;quot;. Please see linked quotations from these test-drives.
           All in all the editions of the 
          &lt;B&gt;Koenigsegg Agera R&lt;/B&gt; are designed to take the Koenigsegg encounter to the next stage both on the road and the track, still keeping the biggest baggage space in the market along with the exclusive Koenigsegg door program and detachable/stow-able hardtop.
           There are several variations between the pre-production car previously proven and the editions. For example, the engine and gear box adjustments are different and some cutting edge internal, framework and sleek features enhance the edition of the Agera that has never been proven before.
           Although giving the same principles and concepts as past Koenigsegg designs, the Agera takes the Koenigsegg encounter to a completely new stage.
           Similar to all past Koenigsegg hypercars, the new Agera is the idea of Religious von Koenigsegg. The Agera has come to life to be able to set new standards for Hypercars when it comes to control, managing, pace, comfort, features and large driving pleasure, while mixing these features with fresh, powerful and wonderful design.
           The name Agera set the overall tone for the new venture. Agera indicates &amp;quot;to take action&amp;quot; in Remedial. It is also short for the historical Ancient greek word Ageratos which indicates &amp;quot;ageless&amp;quot;. These two are very ideal descriptions, for the car building the long run of Koenigsegg.
           The
          &lt;U&gt;&lt;A href="http://carsgrid.blogspot.com/2012/02/koenigsegg-agera-r.html"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Koenigsegg Agera R&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;is designed with the simple &amp;quot;less is more&amp;quot; viewpoint in mind. This viewpoint indicates that the overall look of the car has to be simply sensible with no included features except those simply required to satisfy control, included safety, ergonomics, features and the rules of aerodynamics. We believe that if this viewpoint is followed, the car will also be wonderful as it is simply filled with meaning. A good example is the progress of a dolphin that has had to satisfy identical requirements to be able to reach their present settings through the progress of characteristics.
           The Agera is related, stream-lined and muscle. Its amazing, powerful and unique overall look is truly proof of time. The exclusive overall look and idea of the Koenigsegg CC, designed 15 years ago, is still legitimate, fresh and extremely very competitive today. The Agera control to stay true to the exclusive viewpoint, style of the exclusive CC. As well, it looks, seems and works like something from the long run.
           The Koenigsegg Electronic Differential (E-Diff) is gentle and quicker, when in comparison to conventional E-Diff alternatives. The difference can be found in the fact that Koenigsegg has maintained a restricted slide differential with clothing and security with a built-in amount of analogue restricted slide features. This implies that the effective gas factor can be lesser, more stream-lined and therefore quicker and gentle when in comparison to conventional E-Diff alternatives. The analogue part of the features also has zero producing time as it acts immediately. The analogue program is formulated by a digital effective program.

No other materials than those considered ideal by Koenigsegg are permitted in the internal. This implies that what you get to touching and see inside the Agera is only alloy, graphite, gold and silver coins, alcantara and aniline set. All swap gear is unique and features fantastically exclusive alternatives, as for example the Koenigsegg Ghost light, that make strong alloy control buttons shine with LED operated signs showing out of nowhere. A world first in the car market. The light lights through the billet alloy control buttons and materials by way of almost cannot be seen small gaps, creating fantastic exposure of the signs as well as a very fresh and fashionable overall look, provided by an all-new graphite center system and tube set up.
           The new super light full as well as airbag rim features many vital features immediately in front of the car owner. In the same way to the CCX, the moving paddles are linked immediately on the rim to allow moving without taking your hands off the rim during hard cornering.
           The middle high-definition touchscreen technology infotainment program handles the audio features, sat nav, Wireless phone and additional features such as efficiency measures and car telemetrical data.
           The very comfortable and additionally warmed as well as chairs are great for long trips but also give fantastic side support when required.
