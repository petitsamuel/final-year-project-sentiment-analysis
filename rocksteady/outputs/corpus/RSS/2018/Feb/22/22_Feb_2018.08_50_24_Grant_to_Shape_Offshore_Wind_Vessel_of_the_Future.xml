To use a SCORE grant to talk to operators about features needed and come up with a new design of vessel to effect that is what SCORE is all about – shaping the future of offshore wind off the east coast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- START &lt;%tags%&gt; --&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scandoil.com/bm.tags/manor-renewable-energy/"&gt;Manor Renewable Energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scandoil.com/bm.tags/score/"&gt;SCORE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scandoil.com/bm.tags/walker-marine-design/"&gt;Walker Marine Design&lt;/a&gt;</text><stripped-text>Manor Renewable Energy Manor Venture will be joined by a sister vessel with the help of a SCORE grant – from left, David Burrows, Manor Renewable Energy Business Development Manager; Eric Briar, Managing Director; and James Walker, of naval architects Walker Marine Design (photo: Manor Renewable Energy)
Design of Manor Renewable Energy’s latest crew transfer vessel for the fast-growing offshore wind industry will be shaped with the help of a GBP 50,000 grant to support innovation and cost-saving.
Manor Renewable Energy was awarded the highest grant from the GBP 6 million SCORE fund towards research for a GBP 4 million sister vessel to its 1-year-old Manor Venture, currently working for Siemens on the Galloper Offshore Wind Farm.
The 26-metre vessel was designed by naval architect James Walker, Walker Marine Design, to spend prolonged time offshore with large “ship style” cabins, office space for clients and mess rooms for technicians and engineers.
Its maiden contract supporting Siemens’ work on the Galloper wind farm off the UK’s east coast, refuelling and maintenance of all of the 56 116 KVA generators on the 56 turbines.
Walker will design a new vessel over the next year to service the new generation of offshore wind farms alongside the growth of Manor Renewable Energy’s business in the East of England.
David Burrows, Business Development Manager, says the SCORE grant provided the “right support for us at the right time.”
It will help fund research with wind farm operators and developers to find out what features, design and capability a second vessel would need to save more time on projects, therefore saving costs.
