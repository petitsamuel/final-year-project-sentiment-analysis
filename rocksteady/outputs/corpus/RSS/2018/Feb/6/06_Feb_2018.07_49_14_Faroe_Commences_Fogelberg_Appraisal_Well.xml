Faroe announced the Fogelberg oil and gas discovery in licence PL433 in April 2010. The 6506/9-2 S well encountered gas and condensate in the Middle Jurassic Garn and Ile formations, and no fluid contacts were observed.

The main objectives of the appraisal well are to narrow this range in the reserves estimates and to provide additional information for development planning.
Fogelberg is located 18 kilometres north west of the producing Åsgard complex where large quantities of gas and condensate have been and continue to be produced and transported to several landing points on the European continent.
