The well confirms the southeast extension of the field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When combined with our acquisition of InterOil Corporation, the increase in assessed reserves at Hides in the existing PNG LNG project and our recent Muruk discovery, this adds to our rapidly growing inventory of low cost of supply natural gas in Papua New Guinea,” Mallon says. “We are continuing with our active onshore and offshore exploration program in an effort to provide additional resources to expand existing and planned development projects.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oil Search began drilling the P’nyang South-2 well on Oct. 22, 2017. The well is located in petroleum retention license 3, which covers 105,000 acres (425 square kilometres).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil affiliates operate the license with a 49% interest in the block.
