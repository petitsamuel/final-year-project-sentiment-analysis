The well was safely drilled to 6,450 metres depth in 2,735 metres of water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This latest success operating in Guyana’s significant water depths illustrates our ultra deepwater and carbonate exploration capabilities,” says Steve Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil Exploration Company. “This discovery proves a new play concept for the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block, and adds further value to our growing Guyana portfolio.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following completion of the Ranger-1 well, the &lt;em&gt;Stena Carron&lt;/em&gt; drillship will move to the Pacora prospect, 4 miles from the Payara discovery. Additional exploration drilling is planned on the Stabroek Block for 2018, including potential appraisal drilling at the Ranger discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Stabroek Block is 26,800 square kilometres. Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited is operator and holds 45% interest in the Stabroek Block. Hess Guyana Exploration Ltd. holds 30% interest and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited holds 25% interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- START &lt;%tags%&gt; --&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scandoil.com/bm.tags/exxon-mobil-corporation/"&gt;Exxon Mobil Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scandoil.com/bm.tags/exxonmobil/"&gt;ExxonMobil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.scandoil.com/openx/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a71e1493&amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.scandoil.com/openx/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=51&amp;amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;amp;n=a71e1493&amp;amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text><stripped-text>Exxon Mobil Corporation has announced positive results from its Ranger-1 exploration well, marking ExxonMobil’s sixth oil discovery offshore Guyana since 2015.
