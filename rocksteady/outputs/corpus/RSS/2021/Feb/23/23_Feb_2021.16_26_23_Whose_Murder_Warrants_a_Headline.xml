Fact: race and privilege play a role in news coverage. “Where We Live” on WNPR featured a good discussion on why some shootings (i.e. of Yale students versus other New Haveners) get widespread media attention. Host Lucy Nalpathanchil was joined by Paul Bass of the New Haven Independent, WNPR Managing Editor Harriet Jones, NPR Public Editors Kelly McBridge, and the Pastor at Bethel A.M.E.
