Today, with a bipartisan vote, the Insurance &amp; Real Estate Committee voted to examine the @hartfordcourant’s Corporate Charter. The Courant is the oldest continuously published newspaper in America – predating the establishment of the United States.
This comes as hedge fund Alden Global Capital seeks to buy the outstanding shares of @tribpub and after management shuttered the Courant’s newsroom, closed its presses and laid off reporters and other staff.
On at least seven previous instances the Connecticut General Assembly has modified the Courant’s corporate charter. Previous changes have concerned corporate ownership, and the issuance of stock and debt.
For three centuries Connecticut residents have relied on the Courant – and the goal of our inquiry is to ensure that regardless of its ownership that will continue well into the future.
