                         The act 
                        &lt;A href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1985" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"&gt;reads as follows&lt;/A&gt;:
                         “If two or more persons in any state or territory conspire to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States, or from discharging any duties thereof; or to induce by like means any officer of the United States to leave any state, district, or place, where his duties as an officer are required to be performed, or to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, or to injure his property so as to molest, interrupt, hinder, or impede him in the discharge of his official duties … each and every person so offending shall be deemed guilty of a high crime.”
                         The statute is clearly appropriate for the suit, but what stood out to me was how similar this period is to the period when the law was adopted.

                      But just on the case itself, unless we consider that there is no link at all between anything Trump said or did, including his attempts to intimidate Mike Pence and his phone call to the governor of Georgia, and anything anyone else did, including Rudy Giuliani, it's hard to see how they aren't guilty.
