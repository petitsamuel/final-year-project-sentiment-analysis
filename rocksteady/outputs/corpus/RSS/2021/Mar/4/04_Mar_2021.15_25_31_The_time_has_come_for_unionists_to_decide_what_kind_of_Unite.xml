                         Seems that there's the sash wearing unionists, but also a lot of economic unionists of every background who will want to know where the next £10,000,000,000-a-year &amp;quot;subvention&amp;quot; is coming from.

                         Tesco, compare the same items in newry and dundalk, and it;s a good 20% cheaper up there. Where is all that support going to come from?
                         I don't mind in the least bit having unity in the morning, but it seems unlikely that a lot of nordies will vote to become even poorer than they are now.
                         If the supporters of unity would only arrange a free gift to our new northern province of €11 billion a year from the Usa / EU, that would be just the ticket. I'd be seriously impressed.
                         Britain got into brexit over an £8 Bn a year net cost, so of course a lot of GB voters would want to end this payment of 10 Bn a year.
