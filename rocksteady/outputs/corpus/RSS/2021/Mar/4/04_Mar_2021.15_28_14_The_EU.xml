                     The trade negotiations kick off this week, with the EU publishing their draft position on Monday 2nd Feb and Bojo giving a big speech laying out his position on the same day. So let's think about the details of those positions and the shared ground that could give way to a deal.
                      Let’s assume a few things as given:
                     &lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;The UK and Bojo want a deal&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Whatever deal Bojo brings to parliament will get backed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;The EU wants a deal&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;Priorities imo for the UK (in order)
                     &lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Wanting something that amounts to a deal written and allows them out of the EU rules and oversight by Dec 31&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Cultural and sovereignty issues for England, Scotland and Wales (Fishing. Immigration)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Economic interests (Services, manufacturing movement)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Future and wellbeing of NI and Gibraltar&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Future of UK citizens in EU&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;Priorities imo for the EU (In order):
                     &lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Integrity and unity of the EU. (Backing Ireland/Spain on pretty much anything)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Dissuading other countries from breaking away (No division of freedoms for the UK in any deal)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Economic interests (Manufacturing, Agriculture, Services)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Future of EU citizens in UK&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI data-xf-list-type="ol"&gt;Not creating unwelcome precedents with either existing/prospective trade partners or existing associated countries like Switzerland and Norway&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;So everyone wants a deal and the UK are going to go all out for one this year. And for all the noise that’s around it’s worth going back to basics: The WA has been signed. And there’s a little bit of bleating from junior people on both sides that the UK is pulling back on things they said they’d do, and the EU is messing with what they “promised” the UK: Unless it’s in the WA, it’s not an obligation or a commitment. And if it’s neither of those, then it’s on the table for the negotiations.
                      There's been some spoilers ahead of what the UK wants (No oversight at all from ECJ on anything, which means no EAWs) and what the EU wants (Access for fish, Spain and Gibraltar).
                      But actually: the sides aren’t that far away. Boris’s spokesperson has revealed that.

                         The EU has warned that there is not enough time to agree a comprehensive free trade deal by the end of the year, and suggested that the Brexit transition period should be extended.

                         Cabinet minister Michael Gove said this would mean the UK taking full control of its laws, including the right to diverge from EU regulations.

The UK and Bojo want a deal
Whatever deal Bojo brings to parliament will get backed
The EU wants a deal
Priorities imo for the UK (in order)
Wanting something that amounts to a deal written and allows them out of the EU rules and oversight by Dec 31
Cultural and sovereignty issues for England, Scotland and Wales (Fishing. Immigration)
Economic interests (Services, manufacturing movement)
Future and wellbeing of NI and Gibraltar
Future of UK citizens in EU
Priorities imo for the EU (In order):
Integrity and unity of the EU. (Backing Ireland/Spain on pretty much anything)
Dissuading other countries from breaking away (No division of freedoms for the UK in any deal)
Economic interests (Manufacturing, Agriculture, Services)
Future of EU citizens in UK
Not creating unwelcome precedents with either existing/prospective trade partners or existing associated countries like Switzerland and Norway
