                         But dont expect to read any articles criticising the enormous slow lethargic and incompetent overpaid bureaucracy in Brussels in the irish media .....like the church before it , it is considered sacrosanct and beyond scrutiny or criticism
                         Maybe in September when Ireland is going into yet another lockdown while the US and UK remain open as they have administered sufficient vaccines while we hover at 20% , questions might start to be asked ....but i doubt it
