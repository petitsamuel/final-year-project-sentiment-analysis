                         One thing that always struck me about Ireland is we have no debate no alternative in politics. If you look at it National parties of which we really only have 2 very very small ones in The National Party and the Irish Freedom Party.
                         I think it's a damning indictment of Irish politics that we don't have a credible right. The media's ire towards them is unbelievable and not forgetting the incredibly fascist/draconian left who want to shout people down, call them fascist/racist white supremacist, nazi and de platform then at every single opportunity imaginable. The so called 'anti fascists' attacking people, censoring free speech and even protesting against free speech in Dublin. Have these people ever heard of the word irony I wonder? Imagine saying you are 'anti fascist' yet oppose all free speech? Incredible. If only they had an idea or even a clue as to how fascist they actually are but of course they don't see further than their nose.
                         Now people might argue they don't have much of the electorate true but if you are never given a platform how do you grow it? The slander against some of these people by very often unemployable 'antifa' left loola types in amazing. Like probably no one more educated in Ireland than Professor Dolores Cahill yet they dog her and try get her sacked from University lecturer job always complaining to the University incessantly showing how evil the 'de-platform' lot are. Not that it would bother her that much isn't she absolutely minted?
                         I for one would like a credible right wing in Ireland. We badly need it. It is not healthy for politics to all be the same. Look at all the current parties and left wing parties. They agree on effectively everything major. To me you couldn't get a cigarette paper between SF/FF/FG/ profit before people/ etc they are so close. No difference at all.
                         To illustrate my point we don't have ONE single right wing politician in the dail. This is incredible. It's little more than a toothless talking shop these days. In other countries Spain/Italy/Hungary/France they have proper Nationalist movements and right wing parties some even in government and often given air time on TV.
                         Also do people not see politics in Ireland is an utter utter farce if people have a left but no actual right to counter balance them? In my opinion the left lot are total communists and despise any sort of freedom or Nationalism so you can be guranteed they will do every single thing in their power to shut down debate and any alternative or God forbid any free speech.
