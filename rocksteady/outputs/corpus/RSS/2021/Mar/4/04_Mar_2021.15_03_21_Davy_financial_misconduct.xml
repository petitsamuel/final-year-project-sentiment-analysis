                     Wouldn't surprise me if EU financial regulators ended up looking at this lot. There is a case for interpretation of a breach of EU competition law, because bailing out a private stockbrokers would be the same as carrying a 'golden share' in Aer Lingus- which the government have been told to divest itself of by said Competition Authorities.
                      The regulations of course elsewhere on corruption and insider trading, market-rigging and so on are dependent on national resources being utilised and being found to be inadequate.
                      Which means the Irish Financial Regulator would have to intervene, possibly ODCE, and the regulator's office is actually overseen by the Central Bank ever so not much chance of the Regulator taking an interest.
                      What would blow this wide open is if some shareholders somewhere decided that they had been presented with a false share price in the market and sued (this is in relation to the share-ramping market rigging in Anglo shares during the Maple 10 operation to prop up that company's share price in the market without the rest of the market knowing), and with Davy if it can be shown that any of these 16 were operating off privileged or insider knowledge it would imply someone was actively looking at that element.
                      Which in turn won't happen because it is easier to just cover it up and bill the taxpayer. Sean Public never associates transactions such as selling a brokerage for 24 million and then buying it back later for 138 million on his behalf with the tax that is deducted from his payslip.
                      Sean just might be able to work out that the government isn't an ideal venture partner with a somewhat hazy notion of what constitutes a profit calculation with Sean's money.
