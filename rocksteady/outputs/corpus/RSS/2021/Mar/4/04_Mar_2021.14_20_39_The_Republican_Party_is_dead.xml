                         Certainly, &amp;quot;The Party of Lincoln&amp;quot; is dead, but that died when Barry Goldwater and then Ronald Reagan became Presidential candidates. The last vestige of &amp;quot;Liberal Republicanism&amp;quot; was driven out of the party.
                         What died is the Party of Reagan-Bush, even the embers of any wish to have a broadly-based diverse party representing all Americans of all creeds or colours, is officially extinguished.
                         For a while, we have the Party of Trump, but I tend to doubt if that will last. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now Big Box Office for Republicans, and shw could well run in 2024. Not to mention Tucker Carlson from the Right Wing TV Star Industrial Complex (from which Trump himself emerged), Ted Cruz, or Josh Hawley. Only Nikki Haley might rescue the party from complete inanity, if not insanity.
                         The point is, with the command of key states in the electoral college, a Republican crazy could still win in 2024.
