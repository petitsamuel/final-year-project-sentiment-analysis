                         I know there is already a thread on the FIFA debacle but I thought this deserved its own thread. Of course it is ridiculous to assume that there was a legitimate case resulting from the infamous handball but at the same time, this loan that is now being discussed seems very dodgy.
                         I would assume lots more similar stories will be uncovered in the weeks ahead. The papers have to talk about something in the summer months. Expect a drip feed.
                         So, should Delaney have accepted this money? Why was it given? If it does constitute a bribe, is accepting it as bad as offering it?

                      The FAI lost millions by not qualifying for the 2010 WC, now there is no guarantee that Ireland would have won a penalty shoot out either but the last thing FIFA needed at the time was a headache. It was obviously more lucrative for FIFA to have France there than Ireland, even though the French were dumped out after the group stages. A lawsuit could have created pressure for a replay that Ireland may not have won either so the 5 million was a good way to make the problem go away.
