Risk Of Providing Continual Aid To Banks
With the current debate raging over the best way to apply the remaining TARP fund, there is a tremendous risk that we would not be saving the banks from their own ineptitude, even after giving them the full $700 billion. Here is the basic reasoning, based upon my experience as a risk manager:In risk management, one has to identify clearly the goal and timeline of any risk mitigation planning, the “Exit Strategy.” The Exit Strategy takes into account (a) the probability of various outcomes, (b) their associated costs and benefits, (c) method of measuring and reporting on the progress (transparency), (d) have built in contingency plans to work around potential problems that may occur, and (e) have a clear and easily measurable action plan for achieving best possible outcome.The previous administration completely bumbled in implementing the first half of the TARP.

The Congressional Oversight Panel lambasted the previous administration’s shortsightedness of purpose, poor planning, fumbled execution, lack of transparency, and bad deal making by asking the Treasury in December 2008 the following 10 questions :1.
