In fact, the rating agencies’ disclosures would read something like this:Ratings are based upon information that we consider to be reliable, but neither [Rating Agency] nor its affiliates warrant its completeness, accuracy or adequacy and it should not be relied upon as such. Rating agencies do not perform due diligence and assume the accuracy of the information that is provided to them by issuers and their advisors.

They were here before in 2002, with their &lt;A href="http://hsgac.senate.gov/032002lieberman.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;corporate credit ratings of Enron&lt;/A&gt;: (&lt;A href="http://www.sec.gov/news/extra/credrate/standardpoors.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;S&amp;amp;P response to SEC&lt;/A&gt;; &lt;A href="http://www.sec.gov/news/extra/credrate/fitchratings1.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fitch Ratings response to SEC&lt;/A&gt;; and &lt;A href="http://www.sec.gov/news/extra/credrate/moodys.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Moody’s response to SEC&lt;/A&gt;). The rating agencies’ argument now is the same as it was then: they are not in any conflict of interest and the ratings they provide is beneficial to the market and is simply an opinion protected by the first amendment and not bound by &lt;A href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Regulation FD&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Government Is Forced To Act, Again&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;Again, the market has forced the government to react. Most recently, the SEC released their &lt;A href="http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2008/craexamination070808.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;examination report&lt;/A&gt; of the rating agency and found the following issues, among others:1. Significant Aspects of the Ratings Process Were Not Always Disclosed2. Policies and Procedures for Rating RMBS and CDOs Can be Better Documented3. Rating Agencies are Implementing New Practices with Respect to the Information Provided to Them4. Rating Agencies Did Not Always Document Significant Steps in the Ratings Process5. Rating Agencies Did Not Always Document the Rationale for Deviations From Their Models6. Rating Agencies Did Not Always Document Significant Participants in the Ratings Process Rating7. Rating Agencies Did Not Always Document Committee Actions and Decisions8.

Here are the ICI’s comment letters to the SEC on regulation of the rating agencies: &lt;A href="http://www.ici.org/statements/cmltr/1998/98_sec_nrsro_defin_com_cvr.html#TopOfPage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;1998 comment letter&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="http://www.ici.org/statements/tmny/02_sec_2a-7_stmt.html#TopOfPage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;2002 testimony&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="http://www.ici.org/statements/cmltr/03_sec_2a-7_ltr.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;2003 comment letter&lt;/A&gt;.If the SEC had listen to ICI then or even listen to &lt;A href="http://hsgac.senate.gov/032002lieberman.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Senator Joe Lieberman in 2002&lt;/A&gt;, perhaps things may have turned out a bit better. Perhaps the combined efforts of the EU (European Union) and SEC might finally provide enough momentum in tightening up the supervision and accountability of the rating agencies. Or, perhaps not.It may be a while before any truly innovative accountability and supervision are placed on the rating agencies.

Rating Agencies' Value To The Market? Nada, According To Their Disclosures
With the unraveling of the credit market, one has to wonder what value had the rating agencies actually provided to the investors. It appears quite obvious, in hindsight, that the rating agencies’ values were all perception and not reality. After all, why are financial institutions so busy marking down even “AAA” rated bonds and taking ever-increasing loss reserves against them?If one read the typical disclosure that is on a rating agency rating letter, one would quickly realize that there is no real value.
