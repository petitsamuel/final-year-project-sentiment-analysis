The &lt;A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act,_Title_III,_Subtitle_A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Title III of the PATRIOT Act&lt;/A&gt; provides the Government with additional reach into the international arena to find and persecute money laundering. While the original intent of the PATRIOT Act was to prevent terrorism, the act can be used for any acts of money laundering, be it to fund terrorism, narcotics, or to simply avoid paying taxes.While money laundering has been a major concern for broker-dealers, hedge funds, and investment banks, the same cannot be said for Private Banks.

Increased Risk Of Regulatory Scrutiny Of Private Bankers
Senators Baucus (D-Montana) and Grassley (R-Iowa) of the Senate Finance Committee (SFC) are seeking to place their names next to Senator Sarbanes (D-Maryland) and Representative Oxley (R-Ohio). These SFC leaders are planning new laws against offshore tax evasion .Now offshore tax evasion is not “News” as IRS had complained about this back in 2002. According to Global Policy Forum , IRS estimated in 2002 that anywhere from 1 to 2 million Americans were evading taxes. This is a problem as old as the beginning of time as it is in human nature to abhor having to pay a levy/tax to a central body.
