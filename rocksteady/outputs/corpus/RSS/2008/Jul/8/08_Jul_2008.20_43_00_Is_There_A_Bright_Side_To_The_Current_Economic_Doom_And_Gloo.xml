Is There A Bright Side To The Current Economic Doom And Gloom?
Surprisingly, yes. In fact, there are lots of upside to all this doom and gloom.The major beneficiaries of the economic downturn will be the American consumers. They just don’t realize it yet. Like a person trying to recover from a hangover, consumers are slowly realizing the high cost of their excessive lifestyle of living in a McMansion set in a former crop field miles from a major urban center.Large ostentatious homes will be a relict of past frenzy, much like the Pet Rock craze.

Frugal is now vogue. People are driving less, downsizing their vehicles, conserving more, and seeking ways to reduce their total consumption costs.Industries that will benefitWith consumers strongly signaling desire to reduce costs, those manufacturers that can meet the new consumer demand will benefit. And those companies are:
Makers of the next generation of lithium-ion batteries
Makers of solar energy: Electric Panels, Water Heaters, and Heat Pumps
Makers of Genetically Modified crops and seeds
Makers of Vertical hydro-farming
Green gas capture and trading
Makers of Green Construction Materials
The car manufacturer that comes to the market first with the economically viable 100-mpg car
