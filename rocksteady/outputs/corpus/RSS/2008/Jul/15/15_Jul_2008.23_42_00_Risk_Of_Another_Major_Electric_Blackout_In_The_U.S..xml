According to Energy Information Administration (EIA), our &lt;A href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/electricity.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;electric consumption&lt;/A&gt; has gone up from 3,662,029,012 KwH in 2003 to 3,891,705,491 KwH in 2007, a 6.3% increase (EIA &lt;A href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/elect.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;table 8-1&lt;/A&gt;).We are not slowing down in our demand for electricity.

While electricity demand increased by about 25% since 1990, construction of transmission facilities decreased about 30%. In fact, annual investment in new transmission facilities has declined over the last 25 years. The result is grid congestion, which can mean higher electricity costs because customers cannot get access to lower-cost electricity supplies, and because of higher line losses. Transmission and distribution losses are related to how heavily the system is loaded. U.S.-wide transmission and distribution losses were about 5% in 1970, and grew to 9.5% in 2001, due to heavier utilization and more frequent congestion. Congested transmission paths, or &amp;quot;bottlenecks,&amp;quot; now affect many parts of the grid across the country. In addition, it is estimated that power outages and power quality disturbances cost the economy from $25 to $180 billion annually.

Risk Of Another Major Electric Blackout In The U.S.
With the news constantly streaming about various crises – the credit crisis, confidence crisis, mortgage crisis, and housing crisis, to name a few – it seems that people are forgetting about a looming risk that is just budding its head right now. That risk is the failing electric grid system in the U.S.The potential is the need to replace the aging electric grid system in the U.S., which is so antiquated that another “cascade” failure leading to a blackout , a la 2003, is a high probability. This issue is not something new. In fact, New York Times wrote an article in August 2003 about the dangers of serious failure if the electric grid system did not receive substantial upgrade to keep up with demands.Since 2003, our electric uses have gone up while the electric grid system has been just barely maintained.
