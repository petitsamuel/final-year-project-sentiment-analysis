After all, they have billions to burn. Moreover, if the Japanese automakers are producing cars in the U.S. that averages 32.2 MPG, then why can’t the Big 3? After all, the Japanese automakers are employing U.S. workers and making the cars in the U.S.The U.S. automakers are dinosaurs that will not change the way they conduct business. It is as if the spirit of Henry Ford’s infamous quote lives on: “&lt;A href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Ford"&gt;Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black.&lt;/A&gt;” This inflexible mind set is the death of the U.S. auto industry.We, the American consumer, still desire powerful cars with all the “bells and whistles.” However, in the era of high fuel prices, we also desire high fuel economy. Tesla Motors have pioneered the way to satisfy this need. While their initial 248 horsepower electric sports car is expensive at &lt;A href="http://www.teslamotors.com/buy/resyourcar.php"&gt;$109,000&lt;/A&gt;, with proper funding, it is easy to modify their design, step down the cost, and make it affordable through mass production.After all, the first automobiles were too expensive for common folks. Only through the mass production genius of Henry Ford could the regular American afford a car. Much in the same way, Tesla Motors have clearly demonstrated that electric cars are viable, efficient, and fun to drive. The next step is to make the same technology affordable so that the middle class could afford one.&lt;U&gt;Conclusion – the Dawning of the New Automobile Society&lt;/U&gt;The newly elected President could be the catalyst to push the U.S. auto industry into the new era. The days of internal combustion engine are limited. Along with that, the days of the parts manufactures. The electric cars have simple motor design, making them more reliable. Plug, charge, and go.Gone also will be corner gas stations and many auto repair shops. Yes, there will be job losses but that is inevitable. The positives far exceed the negatives: Cleaner air, lower green gas emissions, no more ground water contamination from gas stations and auto repair shops. One can simply “fuel up” at any electric plug.Let the trucks and buses idle their engines. There is no more harmful fumes or soot. Yes, we will still be burning fossil fuels to generate electricity but with 85% efficiency of an electric motor, as opposed to &lt;A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency"&gt;25 to 30% efficiency of a gas-burning engine&lt;/A&gt;, we will reduce our consumption of fossil fuels, overall, while being able to drive 300 miles on a single charge.I can see a day when we would be looking back and asking ourselves: “How many of us actually remember when cars did not have built-in GPS or used ‘gasoline’ to get around?” I see the day when all cars will be electric and have solar panels (for recharging the batteries) and an emergency hand crank (for those times when you run out of ‘juice’ in the middle of nowhere at night).Until then, I will watch the unfolding of the U.S. automobile industry bailout drama while being reminded of another Henry Ford’s famous &lt;A href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Ford"&gt;quotes&lt;/A&gt;: “I will build a car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. But it will be low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one — and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.” – My Life and Work (1922), Chapter IV.Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</text><stripped-text>Fact 6: U.S. Consumers use about 9.3 million barrels of gasoline/day Fact 7: Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for passenger cars have remained stuck at 27.5 MPG since 1990.Fact 8: Japanese cars’ average CAFE is approximately 32.2 MPG, or 17% more efficient (calculated using the Japanese cars’ domestic MPG figures for each manufacture and weighting Toyota at 50%, Honda at 30% and Nissan at 20%).Fact 9: Tesla Motors is producing electric cars that have been EPA-certified at 227 MPG equivalent .Fact 10: Tesla Motors only needed $105.5 million in private financing to get started.The Big PictureIf Tesla Motors can produce a street legal sport car that gets 227 miles per electric charge with only $105.5 million in private investment, then why can’t the Big 3 U.S. automakers produce something equivalent?
