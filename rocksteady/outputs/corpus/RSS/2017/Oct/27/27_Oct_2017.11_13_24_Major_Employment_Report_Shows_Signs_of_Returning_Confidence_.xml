This increasing activity is leading the higher performing companies to refocus on recruiting quality people to lead and deliver value.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While this activity is being led by a sharp increase in investment in US shale, there has also been an uptick in capital projects being approved which will positively impact the industry across all regions. With our own staff operating in over 60 countries, the increasingly positive tone of our clients and contractors is a welcome signal of the turnaround in the market and the participants in this survey echo that sentiment,” adds Gilliam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alex Fourlis, Managing Director of Oilandgasjobsearch.com, says, “There is a sense of positivity throughout the guide the likes of which we haven’t seen since 2013 and can be read as an indication of a potential stabilisation of the oil market. This is key to kick-start projects that haven’t been viable for a while and will have a positive effect on job volume and salaries across the industry.
