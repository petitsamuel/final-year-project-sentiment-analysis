We have worked with Petrobras, the operator, and our partners to secure technical costs below 20 dollars per barrel. This proves that we are capable of developing competitive deep offshore projects”, declares Arnaud Breuillac, President Exploration &amp;amp; Production of Total. “Following startup of the Early Production System in November, this investment decision further strengthens our portfolio of projects under construction and feeds our production growth post-2020.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First oil started flowing from the Libra field in November with the start-up of the Pioneiro de Libra, a 50,000-barrel-per-day FPSO early production phase to further appraise the field and generate early revenue. As the next step in the field development, the new &lt;em&gt;Mero 1 FPSO&lt;/em&gt; is expected to come on stream in 2021. In the coming years, this development will continue with the addition of at least three other FPSO’s to fully exploit the potential of the field, with a production that should reach more than 600,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Libra Consortium is led by Petrobras (40%) in partnership with Total (20%), Shell (20%), CNOOC Limited (10%) and CNPC (10%).
